    ## 3rd Generation Novato Plumber You Can Trust
    
    We're a family plumbing business—three generations now. 
    We've been working in Marin and Sonoma counties for decades, and Novato is part of our regular territory.
    
    When you call, you get a plumber Novato residents refer to their friends and neighbors—one who knows the neighborhoods, housing eras, water supply quirks, and common problems. 
    We show up when we say we will, explain what we're doing, and clean up after ourselves.
    
    Novato's diversity—waterfront homes, military conversions, rural properties, historic downtown—means 
    plumbing repairs here aren't one-size-fits-all. That's exactly why local knowledge matters.

  <div class="one-column">
    ## Waterfront Plumbing in Bel Marin Keys
    
    Bel Marin Keys is unlike anywhere else in Novato. Homes built on lagoons in the 1960s and 1970s, 
    many with boat docks in the backyard. It's a unique setting—and it creates unique plumbing challenges.
    
    **High water tables:** The ground here is saturated. Sewer laterals sit in wet soil year-round, 
    which accelerates corrosion on older cast iron and creates conditions where even small cracks let groundwater infiltrate the system.
    We've seen laterals in Bel Marin Keys that look fine on camera but are letting in so much groundwater that the sanitary district flags them.
    
    **Moisture and corrosion:** Water heaters in garages, outdoor hose bibs, and any exposed plumbing components 
    corrode faster here than in drier parts of Novato. If your water heater is in an uninsulated garage near the water, 
    it's working in a harsher environment than the manufacturer expected.
    
    **Drainage challenges:** The flat terrain and high water table mean gravity doesn't always do the work. 
    Some homes have pump systems for drainage; others rely on careful grading that can shift over time.
    
    If you're in Bel Marin Keys and dealing with recurring sewer issues, slow drains, or premature equipment failures, 
    the waterfront location is probably a factor.

    ## Hamilton: The Air Force Base That Became a Neighborhood
    
    Hamilton was a military base until 1974, then sat largely vacant until redevelopment started in the 1990s. 
    Most homes here are 25-35 years old—newer than much of Novato, but not new.
    
    The construction was generally solid, but we're now seeing:
    - **Water heaters reaching end-of-life** — Original units from the 90s are well past their expected lifespan
    - **PRV failures** — Pressure reducing valves installed during construction are wearing out
    - **Early tankless water heater issues** — Some Hamilton homes were early adopters of tankless; those units need replacement now
    
    Hamilton also has some unique infrastructure from its military past. 
    If you're in one of the converted buildings rather than new construction, the plumbing history can be more complex.

  <div class="two-column">
    ## Indian Valley: Wells, Septic, and Rural Plumbing
    
    Indian Valley feels different from the rest of Novato—larger lots, more space, a rural character. 
    Some homes here are on municipal water and sewer; others have private wells and septic systems.
    
    **Well water considerations:** If you're on a well, your water quality depends entirely on your aquifer and your well equipment. 
    We see more mineral buildup, more sediment issues, and more need for filtration in well-fed homes. 
    Your water heater works harder when the incoming water has higher mineral content.
    
    **Septic systems:** Septic requires different thinking than municipal sewer. 
    What goes down your drains matters more. Certain drain cleaning methods that are fine for city sewer can damage septic systems.
    If you're on septic and having drain issues, make sure your plumber knows—and knows how to work with septic.
    
    **Pressure and elevation:** Indian Valley has hills. Homes at higher elevations may have pressure issues; 
    homes at lower elevations may have pressure that's too high. PRVs are common and need periodic replacement.

  <div class="two-column">
    ## Downtown Novato: The Oldest Pipes in Town
    
    Downtown Novato has homes dating back to the early 1900s. 
    That historic character comes with historic plumbing—galvanized supply lines, cast iron drains, clay sewer laterals.
    
    We work in Downtown Novato regularly, and we know what to expect:
    - **Galvanized pipes** that have been corroding for 80+ years, restricting flow and ready to leak
    - **Cast iron drains** that have lasted remarkably well but are now cracking at joints or rusting through
    - **Clay laterals** with root intrusion from the mature trees that line these streets
    - **Outdated configurations** that made sense in 1920 but cause problems today
    
    If you're in an older Downtown home and you're dealing with low pressure, rusty water, or recurring clogs, 
    the age of your plumbing system is the likely culprit. We can camera your lines and give you an honest assessment.

  <div class="two-column">
    ## NMWD Water: Two Sources, Seasonal Blending
    
    Novato's water comes from the <a href="https://nmwd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Marin Water District</a>. 
    Unlike most water districts that have a single source, NMWD blends water from two places:
    
    - **Russian River groundwater** (about 80%) — Purchased from Sonoma County Water Agency, naturally filtered through gravel beds
    - **Stafford Lake** (about 20%) — Local reservoir, used more heavily in late spring through early fall
    
    The blend changes with the seasons, which is why some Novato homeowners notice their water "feels different" at certain times of year.
    Both sources meet safety standards, but the mineral content is enough to cause scale buildup in water heaters over time.
    
    NMWD publishes a <a href="https://nmwd.com/your-water/water-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water quality report</a> annually. 
    If you're curious about what's in your water—or if you're seeing buildup and want to discuss filtration—we can help.

    ## Permits: City of Novato and Novato Sanitary District
    
    Novato has its own <a href="https://www.novato.org/government/community-development/building-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Division</a> for permits. 
    Water heater replacements, repiping, and major Novato plumbing repair work require permits. We pull them when needed.
    
    For sewer work, there's a second layer: the <a href="https://novatosan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Novato Sanitary District</a>. 
    If your lateral needs repair or replacement, there's a separate permit process through the District. We handle both.
    
    **Selling your home?** Marin County requires sewer lateral inspections for most sales. 
    If your lateral fails, you'll need to fix it before closing. Better to know before you list.
