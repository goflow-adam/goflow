faqs:
  - question: "Do you provide emergency plumbing in San Rafael?"
    answer: "Yes. If you have an active leak, no hot water, a sewer smell, or a drain backup that can’t wait, call us. We’ll give you a clear arrival window and get the situation under control with calm urgency."
  - question: "Can you help with recurring clogs in San Rafael homes?"
    answer: "Yes. If a clog keeps returning, we treat it like a diagnosis—not just a quick clear. We can clear the line safely and recommend next steps (like a camera inspection) so you’re not stuck repeating the same problem."
  - question: "Do you work on water heaters in San Rafael?"
    answer: "Yes. We repair and replace tank and tankless water heaters. If repair makes sense, we’ll do it. If replacement is smarter, we’ll explain why and size the system correctly for your home."
  - question: "What are red flags when hiring a plumber?"
    answer: "High-pressure upsells, vague pricing, and no clear explanation of what’s being repaired are common warning signs. If you want a quick checklist, see our guide on plumber red flags."

    ### What to do while you wait (a quick homeowner checklist)
    If there’s active leaking, shut off the nearest valve (or the home’s main),
    move anything valuable away from the area,
    and avoid using fixtures that might worsen the problem.
    If there’s a sewer backup, stop running water and call right away.

    ## Other San Rafael Plumbers
    When you’re stressed and water is going somewhere it shouldn’t,
    it’s easy for [the wrong plumber](/articles/plumber-red-flags/) to take advantage of the moment.
    We’ve seen homeowners pushed into repairs they didn’t need, quoted one thing and billed another, or left with a “fix” that fails a few weeks later.
  
    Because we take pride in being great plumbers, we also see it as our responsibility to help you avoid predatory work.
    That means we’d rather earn your trust with clarity than win a job with pressure.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ask for a clear scope</strong>: What exactly is being repaired or replaced, and why?</li>
      <li><strong>Beware of urgency pressure</strong>: “Sign right now or it gets worse” is a common tactic.</li>
      <li><strong>Look for diagnosis, not guessing</strong>: Recurring clogs, leaks, and pressure issues deserve a real explanation.</li>
      <li><strong>Expect clean work and protection</strong>: Your floors, cabinets, and walls should be treated like they matter—because they do.</li>
      <li><strong>Code-aware decisions</strong>: Work done wrong can become a costly problem during a home inspection later.</li>
    </ul>

    ## San Rafael’s Unique Plumbing Challenges
    San Rafael’s mix of older neighborhoods, hillside terrain, and coastal influence means the same symptom can have different causes.
    When you call, we’re already thinking about what’s common in your area and what we’ll likely find behind the walls.
  
    Homes in areas like Gerstle Park, Sun Valley, and Dominican can have aging copper, galvanized, cast iron, or older drain configurations.
    Those materials are more prone to corrosion, leaks, and restrictions.
    Clay drain lines are also common in San Rafael, and they should be cleared carefully.
    
    San Rafael’s microclimates also matter.
    Coastal exposure (and fog) can accelerate corrosion in some areas.
    Hillsides can create pressure irregularities and movement stress that show up as leaks, drainage issues, or recurring repairs.

    ### Water quality, pressure, and efficiency upgrades
    In San Rafael, water quality and pressure can vary by neighborhood.
    If you’re seeing mineral buildup, premature fixture failures, inconsistent pressure, or you want to reduce water waste,
    we’ll walk you through options like filtration, pressure regulation, and efficient fixture upgrades.
