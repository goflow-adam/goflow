faqs:
  - question: Are smart water shutoff valves required by building code in California?
    answer: >-
      No. California plumbing code requires a main water shutoff valve, but
      smart automatic shutoff systems are not currently mandated. However, some
      insurance carriers are beginning to require them for certain
      policies—especially for high-value homes or in areas with frequent water
      damage claims.
  - question: How much can I save on insurance with a smart shutoff valve?
    answer: >-
      Many insurers offer 5-20% premium discounts for homes with professionally
      installed automatic water shutoff systems. Some carriers offer rebates of
      $400-$500 annually. Contact your insurance agent to find out what
      discounts are available on your policy.
  - question: What happens if the power goes out?
    answer: >-
      Quality smart shutoff valves include battery backup that keeps the system
      operational during power outages. Most also have manual override
      capabilities so you can control the valve even without power or
      connectivity.
  - question: Can I install a smart water shutoff valve myself?
    answer: >-
      While some homeowners attempt DIY installation, we recommend professional
      installation. Many insurance discounts require proof of professional
      installation, and improper installation can void warranties or cause the
      system to fail when you need it most.
  - question: Which smart shutoff valve brands are best?
    answer: >-
      Popular residential options include Phyn Plus, Moen Flo, and Watts
      LeakDefense. All offer leak detection, automatic shutoff, and smartphone
      monitoring. The best choice depends on your home's pipe size, your smart
      home setup, and which brands your insurance carrier recognizes for
      discounts.

    Water damage is one of the most common—and most expensive—problems you can face as a homeowner.
    Every day, about 14,000 people in the United States deal with water damage in their homes.
    The average claim runs nearly $14,000, and that doesn't account for the disruption to your life,
    the stress of repairs, or the things insurance doesn't cover.

    The frustrating part? Most water damage is preventable.
    A pipe bursts while you're at work. A supply line fails while you're on vacation.
    A slow leak goes unnoticed for weeks behind a wall.
    By the time you discover the problem, the damage is done.

    A smart water shutoff valve changes that equation entirely.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    **TL;DR:**
    - A smart shutoff valve monitors your water 24/7 and automatically shuts it off if it detects a leak
    - Water damage averages $14,000 per claim—most of it preventable
    - Insurance companies are offering 5-20% premium discounts for these systems
    - Some insurers (like Farmers in California) are starting to *require* them
    - Professional installation runs $500-$1,500 total and may pay for itself in insurance savings alone

    ## What a Smart Shutoff Valve Does

    A smart water shutoff valve installs on your main water line—the pipe that brings water into your home.
    It monitors your water flow 24/7, learns your household's normal usage patterns, and can detect
    anomalies that indicate a leak.

    When it detects a problem—whether that's a catastrophic pipe burst or a slow leak—it automatically
    shuts off your water supply. No waiting for you to get home. No hoping a neighbor notices.
    The water stops, and the damage stops with it.

    Most systems also send instant alerts to your phone, so you know what's happening even when you're away.
    You can monitor your water usage, run system tests, and manually control the valve from anywhere.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## The Real Cost of Water Damage

    Water damage isn't just about the immediate repair. It's about everything that follows.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### The Direct Costs
    - **Plumbing repairs:** $400-$4,000+ depending on what failed
    - **Water extraction and drying:** $1,000-$4,000
    - **Drywall, flooring, and finish repairs:** $2,000-$10,000+
    - **Mold remediation** (if water sat too long): $2,000-$10,000+
    - **Personal property replacement:** varies widely

    A single burst pipe can easily cause $20,000 or more in damage.
    A slow leak that goes undetected can be even worse—mold growth, structural damage,
    and repairs that insurance may not fully cover because the damage was "gradual."
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### The Hidden Costs
    Beyond the dollar figures, water damage takes a toll that's harder to measure:
    - **Time off work** to deal with contractors and adjusters
    - **Temporary housing** if damage is severe
    - **Stress and disruption** to your daily life
    - **Increased insurance premiums** after a claim
    - **Reduced home value** if damage isn't fully remediated

    A smart shutoff valve typically costs $500-$1,500 installed.
    Compare that to even one moderate water damage incident, and the math is clear.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## The Insurance Angle: This Is Getting Serious

    Here's something many homeowners don't realize: **insurance companies are paying attention to water damage.**

    Water damage claims make up nearly 29% of all homeowners insurance claims—the second most common type after wind and hail.
    Insurers are losing money on water damage, and they're responding in two ways:
    **offering discounts for prevention** and **tightening requirements for coverage.**
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Discount$ for $mart $hutoff $ystems

    Many major insurance carriers now offer premium discounts when you install an approved automatic water shutoff system.
    These discounts typically range from **5% to 20%** of your annual premium.

    Carriers offering discounts or incentives include:
    - **Mercury Insurance** — Formal leak detection program with device discounts and premium reductions
    - **Amica Insurance** — Premium discounts for smart water leak detection systems
    - **PURE Insurance** — Up to 5% savings for automatic shutoff installation
    - **State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, Travelers** — Various smart home discounts
    - **Chubb** — Discounts on select policies for approved devices
    - **Nationwide, Liberty Mutual, American Family** — Incentive programs for water protection devices

    Some insurers offer rebates of $400-$500 annually—which can pay for the system within a few years
    while also protecting you from catastrophic loss.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Requirements Are Tightening

    Beyond discounts, some insurers are beginning to **require** automatic shutoff systems
    for certain policies. This is especially true for:
    - **High-value homes** where potential claims are larger
    - **Older homes** with aging plumbing systems
    - **Homes with previous water damage claims**
    - **Properties in certain zip codes** with high claim frequency

    Farmers Insurance, for example, has required automatic shutoff systems for some California policyholders
    as a condition of coverage or renewal.

    Even if your insurer doesn't require it today, the trend is clear.
    Installing a smart shutoff valve now positions you well for whatever requirements come next—
    and may help you avoid coverage complications down the road.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## How These Systems Work

    Smart water shutoff valves combine several technologies to protect your home:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Continuous Monitoring
    The system monitors water flow through your main line 24/7.
    It tracks flow rate, pressure, and temperature—building a profile of your home's normal water usage.
    It learns when you typically shower, run the dishwasher, or water the lawn.

    ### Leak Detection
    When something falls outside normal patterns, the system takes notice.
    Advanced systems can detect leaks as small as half an ounce per minute—
    far smaller than you'd ever notice on your water bill.
    They can also detect sudden high-flow events that indicate a burst pipe.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Automatic Shutoff
    When the system detects a likely leak, it closes the valve automatically—
    typically within seconds. The water stops flowing, and the damage stops accumulating.
    You get an alert on your phone telling you what happened.

    ### Remote Control
    From the app, you can:
    - See real-time water usage
    - Manually open or close the valve
    - Run system health tests
    - Set custom alerts and thresholds
    - Review usage history

    Going on vacation? You can put the system in "away" mode for extra-sensitive monitoring,
    or simply shut off the water entirely with a tap on your phone.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## Available Systems

    Several manufacturers offer smart water shutoff systems for residential use.
    The right choice depends on your home's pipe size, your existing smart home setup,
    and which brands your insurance carrier recognizes for discounts.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Popular Options

    **Phyn Plus** — Known for highly accurate leak detection and detailed water usage reporting.
    No subscription fees. Works with most smart home platforms.

    **Moen Flo** — User-friendly app and setup. Good choice for first-time smart home users.
    Backed by a well-known plumbing brand.

    **Watts LeakDefense** — Professional-grade option often recommended for larger homes
    or homes with multiple water lines. Robust construction.

    **Flume** — A monitor-only option that attaches to your existing water meter.
    Doesn't include automatic shutoff but provides leak detection and usage monitoring
    at a lower price point.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### What to Look For

    When choosing a system, consider:
    - **Pipe size compatibility** — Most homes have 3/4" or 1" main lines
    - **Battery backup** — Essential for protection during power outages
    - **Manual override** — Ability to control the valve without power or connectivity
    - **Insurance recognition** — Check if your carrier offers discounts for specific brands
    - **Smart home integration** — Compatibility with your existing devices
    - **Subscription requirements** — Some features may require ongoing fees

    We can help you evaluate options and recommend the right system for your home.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## Professional Installation Matters

    While some homeowners attempt DIY installation, we strongly recommend professional installation for several reasons:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Insurance Requirements
    Many insurance discounts specifically require **proof of professional installation**.
    If you install the system yourself, you may not qualify for the premium reduction—
    which can add up to hundreds of dollars per year.

    ### Warranty Protection
    Improper installation can void the manufacturer's warranty.
    If the system fails to protect your home because of an installation error,
    you may have no recourse.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Proper Function
    These systems need to be installed correctly to work when you need them.
    That means:
    - Correct placement on the main water line
    - Proper electrical connections
    - Appropriate pressure and flow calibration
    - Integration with your home's plumbing configuration

    A system that's installed incorrectly might not detect leaks accurately,
    might cause false alarms, or might fail to shut off when it matters most.

    Professional installation typically adds $200-$500 to the cost of the system—
    a small price for confidence that it will work when you need it.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## Is This Right for Your Home?

    A smart water shutoff valve makes sense for most homeowners, but it's especially valuable if:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    - **You travel frequently** — Protection while you're away
    - **You have an older home** — Aging pipes are more likely to fail
    - **You've had water damage before** — Prevent it from happening again
    - **You have a vacation home** — Remote monitoring and control
    - **Your home has finished basement space** — More to lose if water gets in
    - **You have valuable belongings** — Art, electronics, irreplaceable items
    - **Your insurance requires or incentivizes it** — Save money while staying protected
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    Even if none of these apply, the peace of mind alone is worth considering.
    Knowing that your home is protected—whether you're asleep, at work, or across the country—
    is a comfort that's hard to put a price on.

    And with insurance requirements tightening and premiums rising,
    installing a smart shutoff valve today may save you complications tomorrow.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## The Bottom Line

    Water damage is common, expensive, and often preventable.
    A smart water shutoff valve gives you:

    - **24/7 protection** against leaks and pipe failures
    - **Automatic response** that doesn't wait for you to get home
    - **Remote monitoring and control** from anywhere
    - **Potential insurance savings** of 5-20% annually
    - **Peace of mind** that your home is protected

    The technology exists. The insurance industry is moving toward requiring it.
    And the cost of installation is a fraction of what even one water damage incident would cost you.
