    Your water heater is one of the most essential appliances in your home, providing hot water for showers, laundry, and cleaning. But like any household system, it won't last forever. Knowing the warning signs that your water heater is failing can help you avoid unexpected breakdowns and costly emergency repairs.

    ## How to Identify Water Heater Replacement Signs

    The average lifespan of a water heater is 8-12 years. If yours is approaching or has exceeded this age, it's time to consider replacement, even if it's still functioning.

  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. Inconsistent Water Temperature
    If your water heater struggles to deliver consistent hot water, it could be a sign of failing heating elements or sediment buildup inside the tank. Fluctuating temperatures are a common indicator that your unit is no longer functioning efficiently.

    ### 2. Rusty or Discolored Water
    When rust-colored or murky water flows from your hot water taps, corrosion inside your water heater tank may be the cause. Rust buildup can lead to leaks and contaminated water, signaling that your unit is nearing the end of its lifespan.

  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. Unusual Noises
    Popping, rumbling, or banging sounds coming from your water heater are often caused by hardened sediment accumulating at the bottom of the tank. This buildup forces your unit to work harder, reducing its efficiency.

    ### 4. Water Leaks Around the Water Heater
    Leaks or pooling water around your water heater can indicate internal damage or cracks in the tank. Once a tank is compromised, replacement is usually the safest and most effective solution.

    ### 5. Age of the Water Heater
    Most traditional water heaters last 8 to 12 years, while tankless models can operate for up to 20 years.
