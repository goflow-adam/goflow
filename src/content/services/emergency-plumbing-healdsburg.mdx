faqs:
  - question: What qualifies as a plumbing emergency in Healdsburg?
    answer: >-
      Anything that can cause damage if you wait: burst pipes, sewer backups,
      active leaks you can't stop, no water at all, gas smell near plumbing.
      If you're unsure, call us—we'll help you figure out if it needs immediate
      attention or can wait until morning.
  - question: How fast can an emergency plumber get to Healdsburg?
    answer: >-
      We're based in Sonoma County and serve Healdsburg regularly. Depending on
      time of day and traffic, we can typically arrive within 60-90 minutes.
      We'll give you a clear arrival window when you call.
  - question: Do you serve wine country estates and rural properties?
    answer: >-
      Yes. We work throughout Healdsburg, Dry Creek Valley, and Alexander Valley.
      Estate properties, guest cottages, vineyard homes—we're equipped for
      the access and complexity these properties require.
  - question: What should I do while waiting for the emergency plumber?
    answer: >-
      Shut off the main water valve if there's an active leak. Turn off electricity
      near affected areas. Stop using plumbing fixtures. Clear a path to the
      problem area. We'll guide you through specific steps when you call.
  - question: Do you handle gas leaks in Healdsburg?
    answer: >-
      If you smell gas, evacuate immediately and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).
      Once they've cleared the area, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line
      issues. Safety first—always.
  - question: Is there an extra charge for after-hours emergency plumbing?

      Emergency rates may differ from standard service, but we're upfront about
      pricing before we start any work. No surprise fees. You'll know the cost
      before we begin.

    ## It's 2 AM. Something's Leaking. We Answer.

    The guest cottage water heater just started flooding. The main house sewer is backing up

    in water wondering who to call at this hour.

    ## What to Do Right Now

    While you wait for us, these steps can limit the damage:

    1. **Shut off the water** — Find your main shutoff valve (usually near the street or where the water line enters your home). Turn it clockwise until it stops. Downtown Victorians may have shutoffs in basements or crawl spaces; estate properties often have multiple shutoffs for different buildings.
    2. **Turn off electricity** — If water is near outlets, switches, or your electrical panel, shut off power to affected areas at the breaker.
    3. **Stop using plumbing** — Don't flush toilets, run water, or use appliances until we assess the situation.
    4. **Contain what you can** — Towels, buckets, moving valuables out of harm's way. Wine country homes often have valuable finishes—protect what you can.
    5. **Call us at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — We'll guide you through anything else specific to your situation.

    **Don't know where your shutoff is?** Call us anyway. We've helped plenty of Healdsburg homeowners find theirs—estate properties can have them in unexpected places.

    ## Emergency Plumbing Situations We Handle in Healdsburg
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Burst or Broken Pipes
    That sound of rushing water behind the wall. The sudden drop in pressure.
    The puddle that's growing faster than you can mop.
    We locate the break, stop the water, and repair or replace the damaged section.
    Healdsburg's mix of downtown Victorians and wine country estates means we see every type of pipe failure.

    ### Sewer Backups
    When sewage comes up through floor drains, toilets, or tubs, you need someone there fast.
    We clear the blockage, assess the line condition, and make sure it's actually fixed—not just temporarily pushed through.
    Healdsburg's heritage oaks and redwoods send roots into sewer laterals regularly.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Water Heater Emergencies
    The tank that's leaking all over the garage floor. The pilot that won't stay lit when you need hot water most.
    The unit that's making sounds like it's about to give up.
    Estate properties often have multiple water heaters—we can handle them all.
    We repair what can be repaired and replace what needs replacing—even at odd hours.

    ### No Water at All
    You turn on the faucet and nothing comes out. Could be a main line break, a failed pressure regulator,
    or something at the meter. Rural properties on wells have different considerations.
    We diagnose and restore your water supply.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Overflowing Toilets
    When the plunger isn't cutting it and water is going places it shouldn't.
    We clear the clog and check for deeper issues in the drain line.
    If it's happening on multiple fixtures, that's a main line problem—and we handle those too.

    ### Active Leaks You Can't Stop
    Under the sink, behind the wall, from the ceiling—wherever it's coming from,
    we find it and stop it. Leak detection equipment helps us locate hidden leaks
    without tearing apart your home unnecessarily.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Gas Line Issues
    **If you smell gas, evacuate and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).**
    Once the area is safe, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line problems.
    We're licensed for gas work and take these calls seriously.

    ### Well and Pump Emergencies
    For rural properties on private wells—no water, pressure tank failures, pump issues.
    We service well systems and can restore your water supply.
  </div>

    ## Why Fast Response Matters in Healdsburg

    Plumbing emergencies get worse by the minute. Here's what can happen while you wait:

    - **Structural damage** — Water soaks into subfloors, drywall, and framing. Downtown Victorians have irreplaceable woodwork; estate homes have custom finishes.
    - **Mold growth** — Can start within 24-48 hours. Healdsburg's warm summers and mild winters create conditions where mold thrives once water gets into walls.
    - **Electrical hazards** — Water and electricity don't mix
    - **Contamination** — Sewer backups create health risks, especially with heritage oak roots common in downtown laterals
    - **Escalating costs** — A small leak becomes a big repair

    We dispatch immediately because we know every hour matters. Healdsburg is part of our core Sonoma County territory.
    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — let's stop the damage now.

    ## Our Emergency Process: What to Expect

    When you call us for emergency plumbing in Healdsburg, here's exactly what happens:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. You Call, We Answer
    A real person picks up—not a call center in another state.
    We ask what's happening, where you are, and give you immediate guidance
    to limit damage while we're on our way. If you're downtown, we're already thinking about that Victorian plumbing. Dry Creek Valley? We're considering well systems and long runs.

    ### 2. We Dispatch Immediately
    Our trucks stay stocked for emergencies. We know Healdsburg—the Dry Creek Road route, the back way through Alexander Valley, which estate driveways require advance notice.
    You get a clear arrival window, and we keep you updated if anything changes.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. We Assess and Explain
    On arrival, we diagnose the problem and explain what we're seeing.
    You'll understand what's wrong, what it takes to fix it, and what it costs
    before we start any work. No pressure, no surprises. For estate properties, we'll also note if other buildings need attention.

    ### 4. We Fix It Right
    We don't do band-aid repairs that fail next week.
    We fix the problem properly so you're not calling us again for the same issue.
    We've been working Healdsburg since before the tasting rooms arrived. When we leave, you can go back to your life—or your harvest dinner.

    ## Healdsburg Emergency Plumbing Challenges

    Healdsburg's character creates unique emergency situations:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Downtown Victorians
    The blocks surrounding Healdsburg Plaza have plumbing from the late 1800s and early 1900s.
    Original cast iron, clay sewer laterals, galvanized supply lines.
    These systems can fail suddenly after a century of service.
    We know how to work on heritage plumbing without damaging what makes these homes special.

    ### Wine Country Estates
    Dry Creek Valley, Alexander Valley—estate properties with complex plumbing systems.
    Multiple buildings, guest cottages, pool houses, irrigation.
    Longer runs, more potential failure points, and access that requires planning.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Root Intrusion
    Healdsburg's heritage oaks and redwoods send roots into sewer laterals.
    Downtown laterals are often original clay or cast iron.
    Valley properties may have longer runs with more potential issues.
    Emergency backups here often involve root intrusion we can clear and address.

    ### Well Systems
    Rural properties on private wells have different emergency considerations.
    Pressure tank failures, pump issues, and distribution problems
    that require specific expertise.
