    military base to family neighborhood. Watching Novato grow into Marin's largest city by area.
    We know this place because we've been part of it for decades.

    ## Finding the Right Water Heater for Your Novato Home

    Hamilton's 1940s utility closets need different solutions than San Marin's modern garages.
    Here's what works and when:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Traditional Tanks
    Dependable and affordable. Gas, electric, or hybrid in 30-80 gallon sizes.
    **Space matters in Novato:** Hamilton homes often have tight utility areas—we carry
    compact models that fit where standard units won't. With regular maintenance,
    expect 8-12 years of reliable service.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tankless (On-Demand)
    Wall-mounted, space-saving, energy efficient, and endless hot water. Ideal for Novato homes where
    the utility closet is already cramped or where a growing family needs more capacity.
    20+ year lifespan, 30% energy savings. Gas line and venting upgrades required—we handle those.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Heat Pump Water Heaters
    Extract heat from ambient air—2-3x more efficient than standard tanks.
    Marin's mild climate is perfect for these units. They need some space around them
    to work properly, so they're better suited to San Marin garages than Hamilton closets.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Comparing Your Options

    | System | Upfront | Energy Savings | Lifespan | Space Required |
    |--------|---------|----------------|----------|----------------|
    | Tank | $ | Moderate | 8-12 yrs | Standard |
    | Tankless | $$$ | High (30%) | 20+ yrs | Minimal |
    | Heat Pump | $$$ | Very High | 10-15 yrs | Medium |
    | Solar | $$$$ | Maximum | 20+ yrs | Roof + tank |

    Not sure which fits your situation? We'll assess your home and give you honest recommendations.

    ## Consider Novato's Unique Water Heater Challenges

    Novato's housing spans decades—each era brought different water heater setups:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Hamilton Field
    1940s military housing converted to residential. Compact utility closets, older gas lines,
    unique layouts from the base days. We've worked Hamilton for decades and know what fits.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Old Town Novato
    Vintage cottages with their own quirks. Tight spaces, older infrastructure,
    sometimes undersized gas lines that need upgrading for modern units.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### San Marin & Ignacio
    1970s-80s developments with more space but aging systems. Those original water heaters
    from the 80s? They're well past their expiration date.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Indian Valley & Rural Areas
    Well water with higher mineral content. Harder on water heaters, more sediment buildup.
    Annual flushing is even more important out here.
  </div>

    ## Costs and Savings in Novato
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">

    - Tankless: $200-350/year
    - Heat pump: $150-300/year
