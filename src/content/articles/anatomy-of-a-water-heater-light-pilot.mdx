    Your traditional gas water heater with a standing pilot is designed to be simple,
    reliable, and safe — but only when it’s handled correctly.
    If your pilot light has gone out, relighting it is often straightforward.
    That said, gas appliances deserve respect. If anything feels uncertain,
    smells unusual, or doesn’t behave the way it should,
    stopping and [calling us](tel:7072008350) is always the right choice.

    This guide explains how the process works, what to look for, and how to do it safely.

    ## Before You Begin: A Few Important Safety Notes

    Before touching the water heater, take a moment to these things out.

    **Do not attempt to relight the pilot if:**

    * You smell gas strongly
    * You hear a hissing sound near the unit
    * The area feels unusually warm
    * You’ve already tried and failed multiple times

    If you smell gas, **leave the area immediately** and contact your gas utility or [call us](tel:7072008350).
    Do not use matches, lighters, or electrical switches.

    If everything smells normal and the area is well-ventilated, you can proceed.

    ## Understanding What You’re About to Do

    On traditional gas water heaters, the **pilot light** is a small,
    steady flame that ignites the main burner when hot water is needed.

    The **gas control valve** has three main positions:

    * **OFF**: No gas flows
    * **PILOT**: Gas flows only to the pilot when pressed
    * **ON**: Gas flows normally to heat water

    When you hold the control knob down in the *PILOT* position,
    you’re manually allowing gas to flow so the pilot can ignite.
    Once the thermocouple senses heat from the flame,
    it tells the valve it’s safe to stay open.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Step-by-Step: Lighting the Pilot Light
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. Turn the Gas Control to “OFF”

    Rotate the control knob to the **OFF** position and wait a minute or two.
    This allows any residual gas to clear out of the combustion chamber.
    You don't want a flashback that takes off your eyebrows.

    This waiting period is critical for safety.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 2. Set the Control to “PILOT”

    Turn the knob to the **PILOT** position.

    You’ll usually see instructions printed directly on the tank —
    follow those first if they differ from this guide.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. Press and Hold the Control Knob

    Push the knob **all the way in** and hold it there.
    This manually opens the gas flow to the pilot.
    If its quiet around you and your ears are better than mine,
    you should hear a hiss as the gas flows to the end of the pilot supply tube.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 4. Remove the Combustion Chamber Cover
    You’ll need to remove the combustion chamber cover or access panel at the
    bottom of the water heater to access the pilot light.
    This panel is usually held in place by clips, tabs, or a few small screws.
    Remove it and set it aside to expose the burner area and allow you to see the pilot light opening.
    Be careful not to touch any internal components.
    They could still be hot.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 5. Light the Pilot

    While holding the knob down:

    * Use a long lighter or match
    * Insert the flame through the viewing opening or access port to the tip of the pilot supply tube
    * You should see a **steady and blue** pilot (not yellow or flickering wildly) flame when it ignites.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 6. Keep Holding the Knob

    Continue holding the knob in for **30–60 seconds** after the flame lights.
    This allows the thermocouple to heat up and generate enough electrical current to keep the gas valve open.
    The electrical current is what allows the gas valve to stay open.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 7. Slowly Release the Knob

    Gently release the knob.

    * If the pilot **stays lit**, you’re good to continue
    * If it **goes out**, wait a few minutes and try once more

    If it will not stay lit after a couple of attempts,
    give us a call at [707-200-8350](tel:7072008350) so we can make sure your issue is not a malfunctioning part
    like the gas control valve or maybe, if you are lucky, just the thermocouple.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 8. Turn the Control to “ON”

    Once the pilot remains lit, turn the control knob to the **ON** position.
    Your water heater will now generate that glorious hot water we can't do without.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## What You Should See Afterward

    * The pilot flame should remain steady and blue
    * The main burner should ignite when hot water is used
    * You should not smell gas
    * The area around the heater should remain calm and quiet

    If anything seems off, trust your instincts and shut it down.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Common Reasons a Pilot Won’t Stay Lit

    * A failing **thermocouple**
    * Dust or debris in the pilot assembly
    * A draft blowing out the flame
    * A faulty gas control valve

    These are all common and repairable — and none require guessing or forcing parts to work.

    ## When to Call a Professional

    Please stop and [call us](tel:7072008350) for help if:

    * The pilot won’t stay lit after multiple attempts
    * You smell gas at any point
    * The flame looks yellow, lazy, or uneven
    * You feel unsure at any step

    A professional can diagnose the issue quickly and safely —
    and often prevent a much bigger problem down the road.

  <div class="one-column">
    Your water heater is designed to work quietly in the background,
    and relighting a pilot is sometimes just part of normal home ownership.
    But safety always comes first. If something doesn’t feel right,
    it’s okay to step back and let a trained technician take over.
    If you ever have questions or want peace of mind, we’re always happy to help.
