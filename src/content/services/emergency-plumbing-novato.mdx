faqs:
  - question: What qualifies as a plumbing emergency in Novato?
    answer: >-
      Anything that can cause damage if you wait: burst pipes, sewer backups,
      active leaks you can't stop, no water at all, gas smell near plumbing.
      If you're unsure, call us—we'll help you figure out if it needs immediate
      attention or can wait until morning.
  - question: How fast can an emergency plumber get to Novato?
    answer: >-
      We serve Marin County regularly and Novato is part of our core territory.
      Depending on time of day and traffic, we can typically arrive within
      60-90 minutes. We'll give you a clear arrival window when you call.
  - question: Is there an extra charge for after-hours emergency plumbing in Novato?
    answer: >-
      Emergency rates may differ from standard service, but we're upfront about
      pricing before we start any work. No surprise fees. You'll know the cost
      before we begin.
  - question: What should I do while waiting for the emergency plumber?
    answer: >-
      Shut off the main water valve if there's an active leak. Turn off electricity
      near affected areas. Stop using plumbing fixtures. Clear a path to the
      problem area. We'll guide you through specific steps when you call.
  - question: Do you handle gas leaks in Novato?
    answer: >-
      If you smell gas, evacuate immediately and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).
      Once they've cleared the area, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line
      issues. Safety first—always.
  - question: Do you work on Hamilton Field homes?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Hamilton Field's converted military housing has unique plumbing from
      its base days. We're familiar with the quirks of these systems and handle
      emergencies there regularly.

    ## It's 2 AM. Something's Leaking. We Answer.

    The pipe behind the wall just let go. The sewer is backing up into the bathtub.
    The water heater picked Sunday morning to start flooding the garage.
    You're standing there wondering who to call at this hour.

    ## What to Do Right Now

    While you wait for us, these steps can limit the damage:

    1. **Shut off the water** — Find your main shutoff valve (usually near the street or where the water line enters your home). Turn it clockwise until it stops. Hamilton Field homes often have shutoffs in tight utility closets; Ignacio homes typically have them near the sidewalk.
    2. **Turn off electricity** — If water is near outlets, switches, or your electrical panel, shut off power to affected areas at the breaker.
    3. **Stop using plumbing** — Don't flush toilets, run water, or use appliances until we assess the situation.
    4. **Contain what you can** — Towels, buckets, moving valuables out of harm's way. Hamilton Field's compact floor plans mean water can spread between rooms quickly.
    5. **Call us at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — We'll guide you through anything else specific to your situation.

    **Don't know where your shutoff is?** Call us anyway. We've talked many Novato homeowners through finding theirs—Hamilton Field shutoffs can be tricky.

    ## Emergency Plumbing Situations We Handle in Novato
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Burst or Broken Pipes
    That sound of rushing water behind the wall. The sudden drop in pressure.
    The puddle that's growing faster than you can mop.
    We locate the break, stop the water, and repair or replace the damaged section.
    Novato's mix of Hamilton Field military-era plumbing and newer developments means we see every type of pipe failure.

    ### Sewer Backups
    When sewage comes up through floor drains, toilets, or tubs, you need someone there fast.
    We clear the blockage, assess the line condition, and make sure it's actually fixed—not just temporarily pushed through.
    Ignacio's clay soil and mature landscaping make root intrusion a common culprit.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Water Heater Emergencies
    The tank that's leaking all over the garage floor. The pilot that won't stay lit when you need hot water most.
    The unit that's making sounds like it's about to give up.
    We repair what can be repaired and replace what needs replacing—even at odd hours.

    ### No Water at All
    You turn on the faucet and nothing comes out. Could be a main line break, a failed pressure regulator,
    or something at the meter. We diagnose and restore your water supply.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Overflowing Toilets
    When the plunger isn't cutting it and water is going places it shouldn't.
    We clear the clog and check for deeper issues in the drain line.
    If it's happening on multiple fixtures, that's a main line problem—and we handle those too.

    ### Active Leaks You Can't Stop
    Under the sink, behind the wall, from the ceiling—wherever it's coming from,
    we find it and stop it. Leak detection equipment helps us locate hidden leaks
    without tearing apart your home unnecessarily.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Gas Line Issues
    **If you smell gas, evacuate and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).**
    Once the area is safe, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line problems.
    We're licensed for gas work and take these calls seriously.

    ### Flooding and Water Damage
    Whether it's a failed sump pump, a backed-up drain, or a supply line that let go,
    we stop the source and help you understand next steps for cleanup and restoration.

    ## Why Fast Response Matters in Novato

    Plumbing emergencies get worse by the minute. Here's what can happen while you wait:

    - **Structural damage** — Water soaks into subfloors, drywall, and framing. Hamilton Field's slab foundations mean water has nowhere to go but out.
    - **Mold growth** — Can start within 24-48 hours. Novato's mild climate is ideal for mold once water gets into walls.
    - **Electrical hazards** — Water and electricity don't mix
    - **Contamination** — Sewer backups create health risks, especially with Ignacio's older clay laterals
    - **Escalating costs** — A small leak becomes a big repair

    We dispatch immediately because we know every hour matters. Novato is part of our core Marin territory—we're often already nearby.
    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — let's stop the damage now.

    ## Our Emergency Process: What to Expect

    When you call us for emergency plumbing in Novato, here's exactly what happens:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. You Call, We Answer
    A real person picks up—not a call center in another state.
    We ask what's happening, where you are, and give you immediate guidance
    to limit damage while we're on our way. If you're in Hamilton Field, we're already thinking about those military-era configurations. Ignacio? We're considering root intrusion.

    ### 2. We Dispatch Immediately
    Our trucks stay stocked for emergencies. We know Novato—the Rowland Boulevard route, the back way through Indian Valley, which neighborhoods have the tightest parking.
    You get a clear arrival window, and we keep you updated if anything changes.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. We Assess and Explain
    On arrival, we diagnose the problem and explain what we're seeing.
    You'll understand what's wrong, what it takes to fix it, and what it costs
    before we start any work. No pressure, no surprises. We'll also flag anything that's not urgent but worth keeping an eye on.

    ### 4. We Fix It Right
    We don't do band-aid repairs that fail next week.
    We fix the problem properly so you're not calling us again for the same issue.
    We've been working Novato homes since families first moved into Hamilton Field after the base closed. When we leave, you can go back to your life.

    ## Novato Emergency Plumbing Challenges

    Novato's diverse housing stock creates unique emergency situations:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Hamilton Field
    The former military base converted to residential housing has plumbing from its base days.
    Compact utility spaces, older gas lines, and unique configurations.
    We've worked Hamilton Field for years and know what to expect.

    ### Ignacio & Bel Marin Keys
    Established neighborhoods with mature landscaping and aging infrastructure.
    Root intrusion, clay soil stress on pipes, and 40-50 year old systems
    that can fail suddenly after decades of service.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Downtown & Old Town
    Novato's historic core has some of the oldest plumbing in the area.
    Galvanized steel and cast iron that's reaching end of life.
    We know how to work on these systems without creating new problems.

    ### Newer Developments
    Indian Valley, Atherton Ranch, and other newer areas have modern plumbing,
    but emergencies still happen. PRV failures, water heater issues, and
    construction defects that show up years after the home was built.
