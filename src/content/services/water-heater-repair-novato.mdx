  ## What to Do Right Now (If You're Without Hot Water or Seeing a Leak)

  - If you see active leaking, shut off the water supply to the heater and move anything nearby that could be damaged.
  - If you smell gas or suspect an unsafe condition, leave the area and call your gas utility.
  - If the unit is older and leaking at the tank, stop using it and call us—tank leaks usually get worse, not better.

  ## How We Handle Novato Water Heater Calls

  When you call, we’ll ask a few quick questions so we can come prepared.
  When we arrive, we keep things clean (drop cloths, shoe covers), communicate clearly,
  and take photos when helpful so you can see exactly what we found and what we fixed.

  Permits aren’t always required in Novato for a simple water heater like-for-like swap,
  but when the job involves more than that (code updates, venting, relocation, upgrades),
  we handle the permitting process.
