# How to Choose the Right Faucet for Your Kitchen or Bathroom

Selecting the perfect faucet for your kitchen or bathroom is essential for both style and functionality. The right choice can improve water efficiency, enhance your space’s aesthetic, and make daily tasks easier. Here’s how to choose the ideal faucet — and why GoFlow Plumbing is the trusted choice for professional installation with upfront pricing you can count on.

### 1. Style and Finish
Faucets come in a variety of finishes such as chrome, brushed nickel, matte black, and bronze. Consider matching your faucet to your sink, countertop, or cabinet hardware to create a cohesive look that complements your space.

### 2. Mounting Options
Choose a faucet that suits your sink’s configuration. Deck-mounted faucets are common on sinks and countertops, while wall-mounted faucets are ideal for vessel sinks or modern designs. Knowing your installation setup ensures a seamless upgrade.

### 3. Handle Types
Decide between different handle configurations:
- Single-handle: Easy to use, great for quick temperature adjustments
- Double-handle: Traditional look, separate hot and cold controls
- Touchless: Modern convenience, improved hygiene

### 4. Features and Functions
Consider useful features like:
- Pull-down sprayers
- Touch activation
- Water filtration options
- Temperature memory
- Pause function
