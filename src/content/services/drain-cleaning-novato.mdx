faqs:
  - question: "What are the first signs a drain clog is getting worse?"
    answer: "Slow draining, gurgling, odors, or water backing up in a different fixture than the one you used. If you notice multiple fixtures acting up, it can be a main line issue—call us before it becomes a backup."
  - question: "Can you clear drains without making a mess?"
    answer: "Yes. We protect the area, work clean, and clean up after. We’ll also explain what we’re doing before we do it—especially if we need to use a cleanout or camera."
  - question: "Do you offer camera inspection for recurring clogs?"
    answer: "Yes. When a clog keeps coming back, a camera inspection helps us find the real cause (buildup, roots, a belly in the line, or a damaged section) so we can recommend the right fix."
  - question: "Is hydro-jetting always necessary?"
    answer: "No. Sometimes a professional cable/snake is the right tool. Hydro-jetting is great for heavy buildup and restoring full pipe diameter, but we choose the method based on your pipe type and the problem we see."
  - question: "Do you provide emergency drain cleaning in Novato?"
    answer: "Yes. If you have an active backup or no-drain situation, call us and we’ll give you a clear arrival window."
