<div itemProp="articleBody">
  <p itemProp="description">
    Your water heater is one of the most essential appliances in your home, providing hot water for showers, laundry, and cleaning. But like any household system, it won't last forever. Knowing the warning signs that your water heater is failing can help you avoid unexpected breakdowns and costly emergency repairs. If you notice any of the following issues, it may be time to consider a water heater replacement or repair.
  </p>

  <section itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/HowTo">
    <h2>Water heater symptoms to watch out for:</h2>

    <p>The average lifespan of a water heater is 8-12 years. If yours is approaching or has exceeded this age, it's time to consider replacement, even if it's still functioning. The risk of failure increases significantly after the 10-year mark.</p>

    <div itemProp="step" itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/HowToStep">
      <h3 itemProp="name">1. Inconsistent Water Temperature</h3>
      <div itemProp="text">
        <p>If your water heater struggles to deliver consistent hot water, it could be a sign of failing heating elements or sediment buildup inside the tank. Fluctuating temperatures are a common indicator that your unit is no longer functioning efficiently and may soon require water heater repair or replacement.</p>

      <h3 itemProp="name">2. Rusty or Discolored Water</h3>
      <div itemProp="text">
        <p>When rust-colored or murky water flows from your hot water taps, corrosion inside your water heater tank may be the cause. Rust buildup can lead to leaks and contaminated water, signaling that your unit is nearing the end of its lifespan. In these cases, a water heater replacement is often the best solution.</p>

      <h3 itemProp="name">3. Unusual Noises</h3>
      <div itemProp="text">
        <p>Popping, rumbling, or banging sounds coming from your water heater are often caused by hardened sediment accumulating at the bottom of the tank. This buildup forces your unit to work harder, reducing its efficiency and increasing the risk of leaks or total failure. If flushing the tank doesn't resolve the issue, it's time to explore water heater repair or replacement options.</p>

      <h3 itemProp="name">4. Water Leaks Around the Water Heater</h3>
      <div itemProp="text">
        <p>Leaks or pooling water around your water heater can indicate internal damage or cracks in the tank. Unfortunately, once a tank is compromised, replacement is usually the safest and most effective solution to prevent water damage in your home.</p>

    <div itemProp="step" itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/HowToStep">
      <h3 itemProp="name">5. Age of the Water Heater</h3>
      <div itemProp="text">
        <p>Most traditional water heaters last 8 to 12 years, while tankless models can operate for up to 20 years. If your unit is approaching or has exceeded its expected lifespan, upgrading to a more efficient model can save you money on energy bills and reduce the risk of unexpected failures.</p>
