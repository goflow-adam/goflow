faqs:
  - question: What qualifies as a plumbing emergency in Petaluma?
    answer: >-
      Anything that can cause damage if you wait: burst pipes, sewer backups,
      active leaks you can't stop, no water at all, gas smell near plumbing.
      If you're unsure, call us—we'll help you figure out if it needs immediate
      attention or can wait until morning.
  - question: How fast can an emergency plumber get to Petaluma?
    answer: >-
      We're based in Sonoma County and Petaluma is part of our core territory.
      Depending on time of day and traffic, we can typically arrive within
      60-90 minutes. We'll give you a clear arrival window when you call.
  - question: Is there an extra charge for after-hours emergency plumbing in Petaluma?
    answer: >-
      Emergency rates may differ from standard service, but we're upfront about
      pricing before we start any work. No surprise fees. You'll know the cost
      before we begin.
  - question: What should I do while waiting for the emergency plumber?
    answer: >-
      Shut off the main water valve if there's an active leak. Turn off electricity
      near affected areas. Stop using plumbing fixtures. Clear a path to the
      problem area. We'll guide you through specific steps when you call.
  - question: Do you handle gas leaks in Petaluma?
    answer: >-
      If you smell gas, evacuate immediately and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).
      Once they've cleared the area, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line
      issues. Safety first—always.
  - question: Do you work on historic Petaluma homes?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Petaluma's historic district has some of the oldest plumbing in Sonoma
      County. We're familiar with cast iron, galvanized steel, and the unique
      challenges of heritage homes. We handle emergencies there regularly.

    ## It's 2 AM. Something's Leaking. We Answer.

    The pipe behind the wall just let go. The sewer is backing up into the bathtub.

    ## What to Do Right Now

    While you wait for us, these steps can limit the damage:

    1. **Shut off the water** — Find your main shutoff valve (usually near the street or where the water line enters your home). Turn it clockwise until it stops. In downtown Petaluma's Victorians, shutoffs can be in basements or crawl spaces; East Petaluma homes usually have them near the sidewalk.
    2. **Turn off electricity** — If water is near outlets, switches, or your electrical panel, shut off power to affected areas at the breaker.
    3. **Stop using plumbing** — Don't flush toilets, run water, or use appliances until we assess the situation.
    4. **Contain what you can** — Towels, buckets, moving valuables out of harm's way. Historic homes often have original hardwood that's irreplaceable—protect it if you can.
    5. **Call us at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — We'll guide you through anything else specific to your situation.

    **Don't know where your shutoff is?** Call us anyway. We've helped plenty of Petaluma homeowners find theirs—especially in those older downtown homes where nothing is where you'd expect.

    ## Emergency Plumbing Situations We Handle in Petaluma
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Burst or Broken Pipes
    That sound of rushing water behind the wall. The sudden drop in pressure.
    The puddle that's growing faster than you can mop.
    We locate the break, stop the water, and repair or replace the damaged section.
    Petaluma's historic homes and hard water conditions mean we see every type of pipe failure.

    ### Sewer Backups
    When sewage comes up through floor drains, toilets, or tubs, you need someone there fast.
    We clear the blockage, assess the line condition, and make sure it's actually fixed—not just temporarily pushed through.
    Downtown's heritage trees and older clay lines make root intrusion a common culprit.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Water Heater Emergencies
    The tank that's leaking all over the garage floor. The pilot that won't stay lit when you need hot water most.
    The unit that's making sounds like it's about to give up.
    Petaluma's hard water accelerates sediment buildup and shortens tank life.
    We repair what can be repaired and replace what needs replacing—even at odd hours.

    ### No Water at All
    You turn on the faucet and nothing comes out. Could be a main line break, a failed pressure regulator,
    or something at the meter. We diagnose and restore your water supply.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Overflowing Toilets
    When the plunger isn't cutting it and water is going places it shouldn't.
    We clear the clog and check for deeper issues in the drain line.
    If it's happening on multiple fixtures, that's a main line problem—and we handle those too.

    ### Active Leaks You Can't Stop
    Under the sink, behind the wall, from the ceiling—wherever it's coming from,
    we find it and stop it. Leak detection equipment helps us locate hidden leaks
    without tearing apart your home unnecessarily.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Gas Line Issues
    **If you smell gas, evacuate and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).**
    Once the area is safe, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line problems.
    We're licensed for gas work and take these calls seriously.

    ### Flooding and Water Damage
    Whether it's a failed sump pump, a backed-up drain, or a supply line that let go,
    we stop the source and help you understand next steps for cleanup and restoration.

    ## Why Fast Response Matters in Petaluma

    Plumbing emergencies get worse by the minute. Here's what can happen while you wait:

    - **Structural damage** — Water soaks into subfloors, drywall, and framing. Petaluma's historic homes have irreplaceable woodwork that water can destroy.
    - **Mold growth** — Can start within 24-48 hours. Petaluma's river-influenced humidity makes mold a real concern once water gets into walls.
    - **Electrical hazards** — Water and electricity don't mix
    - **Contamination** — Sewer backups create health risks, especially in homes with century-old clay laterals common downtown
    - **Escalating costs** — A small leak becomes a big repair

    We dispatch immediately because we know every hour matters. Petaluma is part of our core Sonoma County territory—we're often already nearby.
    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — let's stop the damage now.

    ## Our Emergency Process: What to Expect

    When you call us for emergency plumbing in Petaluma, here's exactly what happens:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. You Call, We Answer
    A real person picks up—not a call center in another state.
    We ask what's happening, where you are, and give you immediate guidance
    to limit damage while we're on our way. If you're downtown, we're already thinking about that Victorian plumbing. East Petaluma? We're considering hard water scale.

    ### 2. We Dispatch Immediately
    Our trucks stay stocked for emergencies. We know Petaluma—the Lakeville Highway route, the back streets through downtown, which neighborhoods have the trickiest parking.
    You get a clear arrival window, and we keep you updated if anything changes.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. We Assess and Explain
    On arrival, we diagnose the problem and explain what we're seeing.
    You'll understand what's wrong, what it takes to fix it, and what it costs
    before we start any work. No pressure, no surprises. We'll also mention if we spot hard water damage or other issues worth monitoring.

    ### 4. We Fix It Right
    We don't do band-aid repairs that fail next week.
    We fix the problem properly so you're not calling us again for the same issue.
    We've worked on Petaluma homes since the days when the river was the center of town commerce. When we leave, you can go back to your life.

    ## Petaluma Emergency Plumbing Challenges

    Petaluma's character creates unique emergency situations:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Historic District
    Petaluma's National Register Historic District has some of the oldest plumbing in Sonoma County.
    Victorian-era homes with original cast iron and galvanized steel.
    These systems can fail suddenly after a century of service.
    We know how to work on heritage plumbing without damaging what makes these homes special.

    ### Hard Water
    Petaluma's water is harder than most of Sonoma County.
    This accelerates scale buildup in water heaters and pipes,
    leading to more frequent failures and emergencies.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Heritage Trees
    Those beautiful mature trees throughout Petaluma?
    Their roots find every pipe joint and crack.
    Emergency sewer backups here often involve root intrusion we can clear and address.

    ### East Petaluma & Newer Areas
    Post-war and modern developments have different challenges—
    aging galvanized in mid-century homes, PRV failures, and
    construction issues that show up years after the home was built.
