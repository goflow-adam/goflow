    ## Common Leak Types Explained
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Supply Line Leaks
    The supply line connects your home's water source to the toilet's tank. Over time, these flexible hoses can develop cracks or loose connections, resulting in water pooling around the base. A damaged supply line can often be replaced quickly, but if overlooked, it may cause significant water damage.

    ### Angle Stop Leaks
    The angle stop, or shut-off valve, is the small valve that controls water flow to your toilet. Leaks here are typically caused by worn seals or corrosion.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tank-to-Bowl Seal Leaks
    The connection between the toilet tank and bowl relies on a rubber gasket that can wear down over time. If you notice water dripping from this area, that seal may need replacement.

    ### Base Leaks (Wax Ring Failure)
    A leak at the base of your toilet often points to a failing wax ring — the crucial seal that prevents water from escaping where your toilet meets the drain. This type of leak requires the toilet to be carefully removed and reseated.
