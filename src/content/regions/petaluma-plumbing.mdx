faqs:
  - question: "Do you provide emergency plumbing in Petaluma?"

    answer: "Yes. We repair and install water heaters in Petaluma, including replacement when repair doesn’t make sense. We’ll explain your options and size the system correctly for your home."
  - question: "What are red flags when hiring a plumber?"
    answer: "High-pressure upsells, vague pricing, and no clear explanation of what’s being repaired are common warning signs. If you want a quick checklist, see our guide on plumber red flags."

    ## What We Fix in Petaluma
    
    <a href="/drain-cleaning-petaluma/">**Drains**</a> — Kitchen clogs, shower drains, main line backups. 
    In historic homes, we're careful about how we clear lines—aggressive methods can damage old pipes.
    
    <a href="/water-heater-installation-petaluma/">**Water heaters**</a> — Tank or tankless, repair or replacement. 
    In older Petaluma homes, water heater replacement often means upgrading the gas line and venting too.
    
    <a href="/emergency-plumbing-services/">**Emergencies**</a> — Active leaks, sewer backups, no water. 
    We're in Sonoma County, not fighting traffic from the city. When it's urgent, we move.
    
    **Sewer laterals** — Camera inspections, root clearing, repairs, replacements. 
    Petaluma's older laterals are often clay or cast iron and need careful assessment.
    
    **Repiping** — When galvanized pipes have corroded past the point of repair, we can repipe with modern materials. 
    In historic homes, we plan the routing carefully to minimize wall damage.
    
    **Toilet repair** — Running toilets, weak flush, leaks at the base. 
    Older Petaluma homes sometimes have non-standard toilet flanges that require creative solutions.

    ## 3rd Generation Plumbers in Sonoma County
    
    We're a family plumbing business—three generations now. 
    Petaluma is part of our regular territory, and we understand what makes plumbing here different.
    
    Historic homes require patience and planning. You can't just cut through walls. 
    You have to think about how the house was built, what's behind the plaster, and how to solve the problem without creating new ones.
    
    When you call, you get plumbers who know Petaluma's neighborhoods, housing eras, and common problems. 
    We show up when we say we will, explain what we're doing, and clean up after ourselves.

  <div class="one-column">
    ## Plumbing in Petaluma's Historic District
    
    Petaluma's downtown and surrounding historic neighborhoods have some of the oldest plumbing in Sonoma County. 
    We're talking about homes built in the 1880s through the 1920s—buildings that predate modern plumbing codes by decades.
    
    Working in historic Petaluma requires a different approach:
    
    **What we find:** Original cast iron drain stacks that have been in service for 100+ years. 
    Galvanized supply lines corroded to the point where a pencil wouldn't fit through. 
    Clay sewer laterals with root intrusion from trees planted when the homes were new. 
    Drain configurations that made sense in 1910 but cause problems today.
    
    **What we do differently:** In historic homes, we can't always take the most direct path. 
    Walls have plaster and lathe that's expensive to repair. Floors have hardwood that's irreplaceable. 
    We plan our work to minimize damage to the historic fabric while still solving the plumbing problem.
    
    **Historic district permits:** If your home is in the designated historic district, exterior changes may require additional review. 
    Most plumbing work is interior and unaffected, but if you're planning something that involves the exterior—
    like a new hose bib or exterior cleanout—it's worth checking first.
    
    If you're in a historic Petaluma home and you've been told "you need to repipe the whole house," 
    get a second opinion. Sometimes that's true. Sometimes there are less invasive options.

  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Petaluma Gap: Wind, Fog, and Your Pipes
    
    Petaluma sits in a gap in the coastal hills—the "Petaluma Gap"—that funnels marine air from the Pacific into the inland valleys. 
    It's why Petaluma is cooler and foggier than Santa Rosa, and why the wind can be relentless.
    
    This matters for your plumbing:
    
    **Temperature swings:** The Gap creates bigger daily temperature swings than you'd expect. 
    Morning fog burns off to afternoon heat, then the marine layer rolls back in. 
    Pipes expand and contract with these swings, which stresses joints and connections over years.
    
    **Moisture and corrosion:** The fog carries salt air from the coast. 
    Outdoor plumbing components, water heaters in garages, and anything exposed to the elements corrodes faster here than in drier inland areas.
    
    **Wind and outdoor plumbing:** The Petaluma Gap wind is famous among locals. 
    Outdoor fixtures, irrigation systems, and anything not properly secured takes a beating.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Petaluma River and High Water Tables
    
    Petaluma grew up around its river—it was a major shipping route in the 1800s. 
    Homes near the river, Adobe Creek, and the various tributaries deal with plumbing challenges that homes on higher ground don't face.
    
    **High water tables:** In low-lying areas, the water table can be just a few feet below the surface. 
    Sewer laterals sit in saturated soil, which accelerates corrosion and creates conditions where groundwater infiltrates the system through any crack or joint separation.
    
    **Flooding history:** Parts of Petaluma have flooded repeatedly over the decades. 
    If your home has been through floods, the sewer lateral may have been damaged in ways that aren't obvious until problems start.
    
    **Basements and crawl spaces:** Petaluma has more basements than most California cities—a legacy of its 19th century construction. 
    Basements near the river can have moisture issues that affect plumbing, including sump pumps, floor drains, and water heaters.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## East vs. West Petaluma
    
    The railroad tracks that run through Petaluma roughly divide the city into two different housing markets—and two different plumbing situations.
    
    **West Petaluma:** Older, more historic. This is where you find the Victorian homes, the Craftsman bungalows, the pre-war construction. 
    Plumbing here is often original or has been patched over generations. We see galvanized pipes, cast iron drains, clay laterals, and the full range of vintage plumbing issues.
    
    **East Petaluma:** More varied. You'll find 1960s-1980s tract homes, 1990s-2000s subdivisions, and newer construction. 
    The plumbing is generally newer, but these homes are now 25-60 years old. Water heaters are reaching end-of-life, PRVs are failing, and the "newer" pipes are starting to show their age.
    
    **North Petaluma:** The newest development, mostly 1990s-2000s construction. 
    Modern materials, but these homes are now old enough that water heaters need replacement and the first generation of fixtures is wearing out.

  <div class="two-column">
    ## Russian River Water via the Petaluma Aqueduct
    
    Petaluma's water comes from the <a href="https://cityofpetaluma.org/water-delivery-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Petaluma</a>, 
    which has been receiving Russian River water through the Petaluma Aqueduct since 1961.
    
    It's the same source that supplies much of Sonoma and Marin counties—naturally filtered through gravel beds, meets all safety standards.
    But the mineral content is enough to cause scale buildup in water heaters over time, especially if you have a tankless unit that doesn't get flushed annually.
    
    The City publishes a <a href="https://cityofpetaluma.org/documents/water-quality-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water quality report</a> each year. 
    If you're seeing white buildup on fixtures or your water heater is struggling, the mineral content is probably a factor.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## Permits and Petaluma's Building Department
    
    The <a href="https://cityofpetaluma.org/departments/building/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Petaluma Building Department</a> requires permits for water heater replacements, repiping, and sewer work.
    We pull permits when they're required.
    
    **Historic district:** If your home is in the designated historic district, exterior changes may need additional review from the Historic and Cultural Preservation Committee. 
    Most plumbing work is interior and doesn't trigger this, but it's worth knowing.
    
    **Selling your home?** Sonoma County requires sewer lateral inspections for most sales. 
    In Petaluma's older neighborhoods, lateral failures are common. Better to know before you list than during escrow.
