    When you call GoFlow, you're not getting a faceless corporation or a revolving door of contractors. You're getting a team that knows this area, knows plumbing, and genuinely cares about doing the job right. We've built this company on a simple idea: **your plumbing problem becomes our problem to solve.**

    ## Leadership
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ### Chris Torres
    **Founder & COO**

    Chris grew up on a ranch, where he learned responsibility, self-reliance, and a deep respect for doing things right the first time.
    At 17, he transitioned that work ethic into plumbing—and more than a decade in the trade taught him how to apply those values in people's homes.

    That background shapes how Chris runs field operations: practical, steady, grounded in problem-solving.
    More importantly, it shapes how he works with customers—listening closely, treating their concerns as his own,
    and making sure problems get solved correctly and honestly.

    ### Adam Bragg
    **Founder & CEO**

    Growing up in a ranch lifestyle and in a multi-generation plumbing family foreshadowed his latest move—creating a next-gen plumbing company.
    His time on jobs, riding along with plumbers, being a grunt, instilled an appreciation for accountability of the job done.
    Lessons learned got him his own truck at a young age—installing water heaters and running pipe at the age of 18.

    Shortly thereafter, Adam moved on to work for companies in South Dakota and Iowa where he went back to school.
    After school and 25 years in software, where Adam developed a systems-level view of how businesses succeed or fail based on process,
    transparency, and customer experience he has returned to his roots as a founder of GoFlow Plumbing.
    Hands-on trade experience with technical and business insight led Adam to the same guiding belief he shares with Chris:
    customers deserve clarity, honesty, and protection.
    Treating the customer’s problem as their own, the founders built GoFlow to represent their experience wrought ethics and goals.
