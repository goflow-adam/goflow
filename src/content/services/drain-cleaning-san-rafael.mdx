faqs:
  - question: "How do I know if it’s a main line clog?"
    answer: "If more than one fixture is backing up (for example, a shower and toilet at the same time), or you see water coming up in a lower drain when you use a sink, that often points to a main line issue. Stop using water and call us so we can prevent a bigger backup."
  - question: "Do you use a camera before you start clearing the drain?"
    answer: "When the problem is recurring, severe, or involves multiple fixtures, yes. A quick camera inspection can show us buildup, roots, a belly, or damage so we can choose the right approach and avoid unnecessary work."
  - question: "What’s the difference between snaking and hydro-jetting?"
    answer: "A professional cable/snake breaks through a clog. Hydro-jetting uses high-pressure water to clean the pipe walls and remove heavy buildup. We’ll recommend the option that fits your pipe type and the actual cause of the blockage."
  - question: "Can you help if my drain backs up during heavy rain?"
    answer: "Yes. In some San Rafael areas, drainage and runoff can contribute to backups—especially if lines are partially restricted. We can clear the blockage and also talk through preventive steps to reduce repeat issues."
  - question: "Will you keep the work area clean?"
    answer: "Yes. We protect floors and surfaces, communicate before we open cleanouts or run a camera, and clean up thoroughly when the job is done."

    You've got a clogged drain. We've got the tools and the skills.
    I think we are a perfect match. We should get together and let us
    clear that backed-up sink, the toilet that won't flush, or your shower pooling water.
    Just [call us now at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)
    and you will have the professional drain cleaning of your dreams.

    **Its not fixed if it just clogs again in a few weeks.**
    A plumber can fix your drain, but it won't be fixed such that it 
    doesn't clog again just weeks down the road.
    Our call logs show many San Rafael homeowners have had plumbers "fix a drain for now."
    Then they called us after to truly fix that drain.
    We find the real cause and fix it properly. That's the only way we know how to work.

    ## Take These Steps Right Now
    1. If multiple fixtures are backing up, stop using water immediately—this signals a main line issue.
    2. If there's active overflow, shut off water to the fixture and protect the area.
    3. Skip chemical drain cleaners—they damage pipes and make your fix more expensive.
    4. **Call GoFlow Plumbing at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—we're ready to move.

    We'll handle everything else from here.

    ## Our Approach: Diagnose First, Fix Right

    We've learned that rushing to clear a clog without understanding it leads to callbacks. Here's how we work:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### First: Understand the Problem
    We run water, check fixtures, and listen to your drain system. Is it one clog or a bigger issue?
    If the situation calls for it, we send a camera down to see exactly what we're dealing with.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Second: Talk It Through
    Before any work starts, you'll know what's wrong, what we suggest, and what it costs.
    We answer questions. We don't rush you. This is your home and your decision.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Third: Clear the Line
    Standard clog? Cable machine. Heavy buildup? Hydro jet. Roots from San Rafael's mature trees?
    Specialized cutters. We match the tool to the problem and keep working until it's truly clear.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Fourth: Test and Advise
    We verify flow is restored, then share what you can do to prevent this from happening again.
    If we noticed something concerning—a crack, a sag, early root intrusion—we'll let you know.
    But we won't push repairs you don't need.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## San Rafael's Unique Drain Challenges

    San Rafael's diverse landscape—from bay-level properties to hillside homes—creates
    drainage challenges that demand a clogged drain company with real local expertise.
    We specialize in solutions tailored to your property's location:

    - **Hillside Homes**: Special equipment and techniques for elevated properties on San Rafael Hill
    - **Historic Properties**: Careful methods for older plumbing in Dominican and Gerstle Park
    - **Bay-Adjacent Properties**: Solutions accounting for tidal influence in Loch Lomond and Peacock Gap
    - **Modern Developments**: High-efficiency approaches for newer systems in Terra Linda

    The hill drainage dynamics, the mature trees with aggressive root systems, the older pipes
    in historic neighborhoods—we factor all of this into every drain cleaning job. That's what
    three generations of local experience gives you.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Emergencies Don't Keep Office Hours

    Neither do we. Sewage backing up in Terra Linda at 11 PM? Toilet overflow in Gerstle Park
    before your in-laws arrive? We've handled both—and worse. Our emergency trucks are always
    stocked, and our team knows San Rafael's streets well enough to get there fast.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) any hour. We mean it.**

    ## Why San Rafael Homeowners Keep Our Number

    We don't just clear clogs—we solve drain problems so they don't come back.
    That's the difference between a quick fix and actual craftsmanship.

    **We grew up here.** Three generations of our family have been clearing drains in Marin.
    We know the hillside drainage quirks in Dominican, the tidal influence near Loch Lomond,
    and why Terra Linda homes have different issues than downtown properties.

    **We've fixed other plumbers' mistakes.**
    Too many San Rafael homeowners call for our drain service after
    someone else "cleared" a drain that clogged again in weeks.
    We'd rather take the time to do it right the first time.

    **No surprises on the bill.** The quote we give is the price you pay. Period.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350 and let's get this done right.](tel:7072008350)**

    ## Drain Care Tips From the Pros
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Smart Habits:
    - Strainers in every drain catch problems before they start
    - Hot water after the disposal keeps grease moving
    - Annual check-ups if you've had repeat clogs
    - Address slow drains early—they always get worse
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### What to Skip:
    - Pouring grease down any drain (it hardens and traps debris)
    - Flushing wipes, even "flushable" ones (they're not)
    - Store-bought drain chemicals (they corrode pipes)
    - Pretending that gurgling sound will go away
