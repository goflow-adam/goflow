    **We want to solve your water heater problem.**<br />
    That leaking tank, those strange noises,
    the cold showers—we're already mentally rolling up our sleeves.
    [Call us now at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let us take this off your plate
    with a solution that's quick, reliable, clean, and built to last.

    **We refuse to let you end up with substandard work.**
    Too many Petaluma homeowners have called us to fix botched water heater installations
    from other companies—improper venting, wrong pipe sizing, code violations that cost
    thousands to correct. That's not happening to you. Not on our watch.

    ## Before We Arrive
    1. **Call us at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—we'll get you on the schedule.
    2. Leaking? Turn off the cold water valve on top of the tank to stop the flow.
    3. Smell gas? Get everyone out and call PG&E before anything else.
    4. If the tank itself is cracked, don't try to run it—you'll make the damage worse.

    Once you've called, relax. We've got this.

    ## The Petaluma Approach to Water Heater Service

    Drop cloths go down before tools come out. Shoe covers go on at your door.
    Your home will be cleaner when we leave than when we arrived—that's not a slogan, it's how we work.

    We'll walk you through what we find and what your options are. No pressure, no jargon.
    If permits are needed (Petaluma requires them for most installations), we handle the paperwork
    and schedule the city inspection. You don't have to think about it.

    Three generations of our family have worked on Petaluma water heater repairs and installations.
    We know which neighborhoods have the hardest water, which older homes have undersized gas lines,
    and what the local inspectors look for. This knowledge saves you time and money.

    **Ready? [Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's get started.**

    ## Choosing a Water Heater for Petaluma's Hard Water
    Not every water heater survives Petaluma's mineral-heavy water equally well.
    Here's what we recommend based on decades of local experience:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Standard Tanks
    The familiar choice—affordable upfront and easy to maintain. Gas, electric, or hybrid.
    **The catch in Petaluma Plumbing:** Hard water deposits build up fast. Without annual flushing,
    you'll lose 2-3 years of lifespan. We can set you up on a maintenance schedule.
    30-80 gallon sizes available. Expect 8-12 years with proper care.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### On-Demand Tankless
    No tank means no sediment sitting in standing water. That's a real advantage here.
    Tankless water heaters often outlast tanks in Petaluma by 5+ years because mineral buildup
    affects them differently. Endless hot water, wall-mounted, 20+ year lifespan.
    Requires gas line and venting upgrades—we handle all of it.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Heat Pump Units
    Pull heat from the air instead of generating it—2-3x more efficient.
    Petaluma's mild climate is ideal for these. They struggle below 40°F,
    but we rarely see those temperatures. Added bonus: they dehumidify your space.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Solar-Assisted Systems
    Petaluma averages 260 sunny days per year—plenty to make solar worthwhile.
    Federal and state incentives cut the upfront cost significantly.
    We always include backup heating for foggy weeks and winter.

    If you're upgrading to a more efficient system, you're also cutting 2-3 tons of CO2 annually.
    Good for your bills, good for the planet.

  <div class="one-column">
    ## Questions Petaluma Homeowners Ask

    **How long will installation take?**
    Typically 2-4 hours for a straightforward swap. Longer if we're upgrading to tankless
    (which requires gas line and venting work) or if code updates are needed.

    **Do I really need a permit?**
    In Petaluma, yes. We handle the permit and schedule the inspection—you don't have to do anything.

    **Why does my water heater fail faster here than my old house?**
    Petaluma's water is harder than many areas. The minerals build up inside your tank,
    reducing efficiency and eventually causing failure. Annual flushing extends lifespan significantly.

    **Can you come tonight?**
    Yes. We offer 24/7 emergency service. Call [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) any time.
