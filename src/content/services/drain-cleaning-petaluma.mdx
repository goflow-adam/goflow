faqs:
  - question: How do I know if a clog is in my fixture or the main line?
    answer: >-
      If only one sink/shower is slow, it may be a localized clog. If multiple
      fixtures are backing up (or a downstairs drain backs up when you run water
      upstairs), that often points to a main line issue. Stop running water and
      call us so we can prevent a bigger backup.
  - question: Do you work on older Petaluma plumbing like cast iron or clay lines?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Older systems often need a more careful approach. We'll choose the
      right method for your pipe type, explain the plan, and avoid unnecessary
      damage—especially in historic homes and buildings.
  - question: What causes recurring clogs?
    answer: >-
      Common causes include grease buildup, roots, pipe scale, a belly (sag) in
      the line, or a damaged section. If a clog keeps returning, a camera
      inspection can show us the real cause so we can recommend the right fix.
  - question: Is hydro-jetting service safe for my pipes?
    answer: >-
      It depends on the pipe type and condition. Hydro-jetting is excellent for
      heavy buildup, but we won't use it when it's not appropriate. We'll
      recommend the safest option that solves the problem and reduces repeat
      clogs.
  - question: Can you help if my kitchen drain keeps clogging?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Kitchen lines often clog from grease and food buildup. We can clear
      the blockage and, if needed, clean the line so it drains well—then give
      you simple prevention steps that actually work.
  - question: Do you snake drains in Petaluma?
    answer: >-
      Yes. We use professional drain snakes (cables) for most clogs. For tougher
      blockages like roots, we use cutting heads or hydro-jetting. The right
      tool depends on what's causing the clog.
  - question: What Petaluma clogged drain cleaning service do you recommend?
    answer: >-
      GoFlow. We're 3rd generation plumbers who've been providing drain clearing
      in Petaluma for decades. We diagnose the cause, clear the clog completely,
      and can camera-inspect to check pipe condition. Call (707) 200-8350.

    ## You Need Drain Cleaning in Petaluma. We're On It.

    **Your clogged drain just became our problem to solve.**<br />
    That backed-up sink, the shower that won't drain, the toilet that keeps overflowing—we're
    already grabbing our gear. **[Call us now at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**
    and we will get your day back on track starting now.

    **We refuse to let you end up with a pseudo-fixed drain.**
    Too many Petaluma homeowners have called us after another company "cleared" a clog
    that came right back. We don't just push the problem down the line—we find the real
    cause and fix it properly. That's the only way we know how to work.

    ## Take These Steps Right Now
    1. **Call GoFlow Plumbing at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—we're ready to move.
    2. If multiple fixtures are backing up, stop using water immediately—this signals a main line issue.
    3. If there's active overflow, protect the area from water damage and avoid chemical drain cleaners (they often make things worse).
    4. If it's a single slow drain, we can still help—especially if it keeps coming back.

    We'll handle everything else from here.

    ## A Drain Cleaning Service in Petaluma Built on Respect

    Drop cloths and shoe covers are just the start of the respect we show your home.
    We treat your home like our own mom's.
    When we leave, **your home will be cleaner than when we arrived.**
    We walk you through every option—honest guidance from plumbers who genuinely want
    the best outcome for you, not the biggest invoice.

    Some clogs need a simple cable clearing or rooter service. Some need a camera inspection to find the real cause.
    Some need hydro jetting when buildup is the culprit. We'll explain what we recommend and why,
    then do the work cleanly and carefully—especially in older Petaluma plumbing where the wrong
    approach can cause expensive drain repair bills.

    Three generations of our family have been providing drain cleaning services in Petaluma.
    We know the clay soil issues, the heritage tree root patterns, and exactly what your home needs.
    This isn't just a job for us—it's our craft.

    **Ready to get this solved? [Give us a call at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350).**

    ## Why Petaluma Calls Us First

    We fix drains so they stay fixed. When we pack up and leave, you shouldn't have to
    think about that drain again for years. That's the standard we hold ourselves to.

    **Petaluma is home.** Three generations of our family have worked these streets.
    We know which neighborhoods have clay pipes, which have cast iron, and which have
    root problems from those beautiful heritage oaks. We don't guess—we know.

    **We've seen every shortcut fail.** Other plumbers punch through clogs and call it done.
    We've been called to re-fix those jobs too many times. We'd rather do it right once.

    **The price we quote is the price you pay.** No surprise line items. No "while we're here" upsells.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's get this handled.**

    ## Our Process: No Guessing, Just Results

    Petaluma's mix of historic homes and newer construction means we can't use a one-size-fits-all approach:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. Find the Problem
    We run water, check fixtures, and listen to your plumbing system. One clog or a bigger issue?
    Cameras go in when we need to see what's happening deep in the line.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 2. Explain Everything
    You'll know what we found and what it costs before we touch anything.
    Plain English. No games. You decide what makes sense.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. Clear It Out
    Cable machine for routine clogs. Hydro jetting for stubborn buildup.
    Root cutters when Petaluma's heritage oaks have found their way in.
    We keep at it until the drain line is truly clear.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 4. Confirm and Advise
    We verify everything flows freely, then share tips to prevent future problems.
    If we spotted something concerning, we'll mention it—but we don't push repairs you don't need.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Midnight Backup? We're On It.

    Clogs don't check the clock, and neither do we. Flooded basement on D Street at 2 AM?
    Kitchen backup in Westridge before Sunday brunch? We've handled both—and worse.
    Our trucks stay stocked, and we've been answering emergency calls in Petaluma for decades.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) whenever you need us. Seriously, any hour.**

    ## What Makes Petaluma Drain Cleaning Different

    Petaluma's architectural heritage—from restored Victorians downtown to mid-century ranch homes
    on the west side—demands real local expertise. Here's what makes a drain clogged in Petaluma different:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Historic District
    D Street, downtown, the areas on the National Register—some of the oldest plumbing in Sonoma County.
    Century-old cast iron, clay pipes, drain configurations that made sense in 1910. 
    We use careful techniques that don't destroy what makes these homes special.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### West Side Ranch Homes
    Mid-century homes with mature landscaping. Those heritage oaks planted 50 years ago?
    Their roots are now finding every pipe joint. We're root-conscious and know what we're walking into.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### River-Adjacent Properties
    The Petaluma River and high water tables affect drainage downtown and in low-lying areas.
    Saturated soil, sewer laterals sitting in wet ground, different challenges than the hills.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### East Side & Newer Areas
    1990s-2000s construction with modern materials—but these homes are now 25-30 years old.
    First-generation fixtures wearing out, original drain systems showing their age.

    - Strainers in every drain—cheap insurance
    - Hot water flush after running the disposal
    - Deal with slow drains before they stop completely
    - Maintenance visits if you've had recurring problems
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Stuff That Causes Problems:
    - Grease down the drain (it solidifies and catches everything)
    - "Flushable" wipes (they're not, really)
    - Chemical drain cleaners (they eat your pipes)
    - That gurgling sound you've been ignoring (that's your drain asking for help)
