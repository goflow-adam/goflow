### Plumbing emergencies don’t wait—so we don’t either.

When a pipe bursts, a toilet overflows, or a leak won’t stop, you need a plumber who can get control of the situation quickly and safely.
We show up prepared, protect your home, explain the options, and get the repair done cleanly.

If you’re not sure whether it’s an emergency, call anyway. We’ll help you assess the risk and tell you what to do next.

<div class="two-column">
## What to Do Right Now (Before We Arrive)

- If water is actively leaking or spraying, shut off the nearest valve (or the home’s main).
- If there’s a sewer backup, stop running water.
- If you smell gas, leave the area and call your gas utility.
- If possible, move valuables away from the affected area.

If you want more context on avoiding predatory “emergency” upsells, read: [plumber red flags](/articles/plumber-red-flags/).
