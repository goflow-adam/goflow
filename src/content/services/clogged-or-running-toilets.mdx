### When your toilet is misbehaving, you need a fix that protects your home.

A clogged toilet can turn into an overflow.
A running toilet can quietly waste a shocking amount of water.
A leak at the base can damage flooring before you notice.

Tell us what it’s doing and we’ll make your problem ours.

<div class="two-column">
## What to Do Right Now

- If the bowl water is rising, shut off the water at the toilet stop valve (usually behind the toilet).
- If you only have one toilet and it’s clogged, don’t keep flushing—call before it overflows.
- If the toilet keeps running, the fastest way to stop the waste is shutting off that stop valve until we arrive.
