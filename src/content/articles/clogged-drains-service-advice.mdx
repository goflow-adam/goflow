# What Not to Put Down Your Drains: A Homeowner's Guide

<div>
  <p>
    Keeping your drains clear is essential for maintaining a healthy plumbing system. To avoid clogs and costly repairs, it's important to know what shouldn't go down your sinks and drains. Here are some common culprits that can cause major blockages and require drain clearing services:
  </p>

  <section>
    ## How to Avoid Clogged Drains: What Not to Put Down Your Drains
    <div>
      ### Grease and Cooking Oils
      <div>
        <p>These substances may seem harmless in liquid form, but they cool and harden inside your pipes, leading to stubborn clogs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      ### Coffee Grounds
      <div>
        <p>Often mistaken for easily washable waste, coffee grounds clump together in pipes, forming dense blockages.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      ### Food Scraps
      <div>
        <p>Even small food particles can build up over time and clog your kitchen sink drain.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      ### Hair and Soap Scum
      <div>
        <p>In bathroom drains, hair and soap residue often combine to create difficult-to-clear clogs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      ### Flushable Wipes
      <div>
        <p>Despite their name, flushable wipes don't break down like toilet paper and frequently clog sewer lines. They also catch on the inside of pipes in older homes creating buildup that eventually becomes a blockage.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      ### Squirrels
      <div>
        <p>These are never a good idea to flush down the drain. Many people believe that if the squirrel is still alive, it will find its way out to the ocean with the rest of their friends, but this just is not the case.</p>
