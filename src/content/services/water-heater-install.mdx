### A water heater install is about comfort now—and fewer problems later.

When your water heater is aging, leaking, or simply not keeping up, you’re not shopping for a box.
You’re trying to protect your home and get back to reliable hot water—so
you’re not stuck with cold showers.

We provide the same standards we’d want in our own home.
The standard we hold ourselves to in our water heater services
is we deliver the same we would provide our own moms: clear options, clean work, and no shortcuts.

Not sure whether replacement is the right move?

<div class="two-column">
## What to Do Right Now (If You Have a Leak or No Hot Water)

- If you see active leaking, shut off the cold supply to the heater.
- If the tank is leaking from the body, stop using it—tank leaks typically get worse.
- If you smell gas, leave the area and call your gas utility.
- If you need urgent help, start here: [24/7 emergency plumbing](/emergency-plumbing-services/).

## How We Size the Right Water Heater (So You Don’t Regret the Install)
</div>

<div class="two-column">
### 1. Plumbing + Safety Check

We only recommend a solution after we look at what you and your home needs
to support the system safely and to code:

- Existing shutoffs, supply lines, and condition of connections
- Water pressure and flow rate
- Gas line and venting requirements for gas water heaters
- Electrical requirements (when applicable)
- Where the water heater is located, clearances, and code items
</div>

<div class="two-column">
### 2. Hot Water Use Reality Check

We size based on how your household actually uses hot water:

- Number of people in the home
- Peak usage windows (mornings/evenings)
- Simultaneous fixtures (showers + laundry + dishwasher)
- Comfort expectations vs. efficiency priorities
</div>

<div class="two-column">
### 3. Options + Cost Clarity

Then we lay out the options clearly:

- The type of water heater that fits your home: tank vs tankless units vs heat pump
- Upfront cost vs operating cost
- What upgrades (if any) are required to do it correctly
- Whether energy efficient options make sense for your usage
