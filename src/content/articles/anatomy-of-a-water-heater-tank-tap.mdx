    ## What’s Protecting Your Hot Water From the Inside Out

    At first glance, your water heater looks like a simple metal cylinder sitting quietly in a corner.
    But beneath that outer shell is a carefully layered system designed to hold pressure, retain heat,
    and safely store hot water day after day.
    Understanding what’s inside your tank helps explain why water heaters last as long as they do —
    and why small issues can sometimes lead to bigger ones if left unchecked.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Outer Shell: Protection and Structure
  
    The outer shell is the metal casing you see from the outside.
    Its job is to protect the internal components and provide structural strength.
    While it doesn’t directly touch water, it shields everything inside from bumps,
    moisture, and temperature changes in the surrounding space.

    If you ever notice dents, rust, or corrosion on the outer shell, it’s worth paying attention.
    While cosmetic damage isn’t always urgent, corrosion can be an early sign of moisture exposure or internal leaks.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Insulation Layer: Holding the Heat

    Just beneath the shell is a thick layer of insulation — usually foam — designed to keep heat inside the tank.
    This insulation helps your water heater maintain temperature efficiently,
    reducing how often the burner needs to fire.

    Good insulation means:

    * Lower energy use
    * More consistent water temperature
    * Reduced heat loss into surrounding spaces

    When insulation breaks down over time, the unit may work harder to maintain temperature,
    which can increase wear and energy costs.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Inner Tank: Where the Work Happens

    Inside the insulation is the tank itself — typically made of steel and lined with a protective
    glass or enamel coating. This lining helps prevent rust and corrosion caused by constant exposure to hot water.

    Despite this protective lining, no tank lasts forever. Over time, minerals in the water settle at the bottom,
    and small imperfections can develop. This is why regular maintenance and inspections are important —
    they help extend the life of the tank before leaks occur.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Drain Valve: A Small Part With a Big Job

    At the base of your water heater is the **drain valve**, a small but important component.
    This valve allows water — and built-up sediment — to be safely drained from the tank during
    maintenance or replacement.

    Sediment naturally accumulates over time, especially in areas with hard water.
    If left alone, it can:

    * Reduce heating efficiency
    * Create popping or rumbling noises
    * Contribute to premature tank failure

    Draining the tank periodically helps flush out this buildup and keeps the system operating smoothly.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## What to Watch For

    Some signs that your tank or drain valve may need attention include:

    * Water pooling near the base of the heater
    * Rust-colored water from hot taps
    * Difficulty turning the drain valve
    * Rumbling or knocking sounds during heating

    If the drain valve is leaking or stuck, it’s best not to force it — older valves can break when disturbed.
  </div>

    ## Built to Work Quietly, Until It Can’t

    Your water heater’s tank is designed to do its job silently and reliably for years.
    But once its internal layers begin to fail, problems can escalate quickly.
    Knowing how it’s built — and what signs to watch for —
    gives you a better chance to act early and avoid sudden surprises.

    If you ever have questions about your tank’s condition or want peace of mind,
    a professional inspection can help ensure everything is still working exactly as it should.
