faqs:
  - question: How do I know if it’s a main line clog?
    answer: >-
      If more than one fixture is backing up (for example, a shower and toilet
      at the same time), or you see water coming up in a lower drain when you
      use a sink, that often points to a main line issue. Stop using water and
      call us so we can prevent a bigger backup.
  - question: Do you use a camera before you start clearing the drain?
    answer: >-
      When the problem is recurring, severe, or involves multiple fixtures, yes.
      A quick camera inspection can show us buildup, roots, a belly, or damage
      so we can choose the right approach and avoid unnecessary work.
  - question: What’s the difference between snaking and hydro-jetting?
    answer: >-
      A professional cable/snake breaks through a clog. Hydro-jetting uses
      high-pressure water to clean the pipe walls and remove heavy buildup.
      We’ll recommend the option that fits your pipe type and the actual cause
      of the blockage.
  - question: Can you help if my drain backs up during heavy rain?
    answer: >-
      Yes. In some San Rafael areas, drainage and runoff can contribute to
      backups—especially if lines are partially restricted. We can clear the
      blockage and also talk through preventive steps to reduce repeat issues.
  - question: Will you keep the work area clean?
    answer: >-
      Yes. We protect floors and surfaces, communicate before we open cleanouts
      or run a camera, and clean up thoroughly when the job is done.

    You've got a clogged drain. We've got the tools and the skills.
    I think we are a perfect match. We should get together and let us
    clear that backed-up sink, the toilet that won't flush, or your shower pooling water.
    Just [call us now at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)
    and you will have the professional drain cleaning services of your dreams.

    **Its not fixed if it just clogs again in a few weeks.**
    A plumber can fix your drain, but it won't be fixed such that it 
    doesn't clog again just weeks down the road.
    Our call logs show many San Rafael homeowners have had plumbers "fix a drain for now."
    Then they called us after to truly fix that drain.
    We find the real cause and fix it properly. That's the only way we know how to work.

    ## Take These Steps Right Now
    1. If multiple fixtures are backing up, stop using water immediately—this signals a main line issue.
    2. If there's active overflow, shut off water to the fixture and protect the area.
    3. Skip chemical drain cleaners—they damage pipes and make your fix more expensive.
    4. **Call GoFlow Plumbing at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—we're ready to move.

    We'll handle everything else from here.

    ## Why San Rafael Homeowners Keep Our Number

    They don't call us back for the same clog—we fix those permanently. 
    They call us back because when something else goes wrong, they remember how we handled the last job.

    **We grew up here.** Three generations of our family have been clearing drains in Marin.
    We know the hillside drainage quirks in Dominican, the tidal influence near Loch Lomond,
    and why Terra Linda homes have different issues than downtown properties.

    **We've fixed other plumbers' mistakes.** Too many San Rafael homeowners call us after
    another plumber in San Rafael "cleared" a drain that clogged again in weeks. We'd rather do it right the first time.

    **No surprises on the bill.** The quote we give is the price you pay. Period.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's get this done right.**

    ## What We Clear in San Rafael Homes

    From Terra Linda to Gerstle Park, we've unclogged every type of drain San Rafael can throw at us:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bathroom Troubles
    - Toilets that won't cooperate
    - Shower floors turning into wading pools
    - Tubs that hold water long after you've dried off
    - Bathroom sinks making strange noises
    - When everything backs up at once
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Kitchen Headaches

    ## Our Process: Diagnose First, Fix Right

    Rushing to clear a clog without understanding it leads to callbacks. Here's how we actually work:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. Understand the Problem
    We run water, check fixtures, and listen to your system. One clog or a bigger issue?
    Cameras go in when we need to see what's happening deep in the line.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 2. Talk It Through
    Before any work starts, you'll know what's wrong, what we suggest, and what it costs.
    Plain English. No pressure. Your home, your decision.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. Clear the Line
    Cable machine for routine clogs. Hydro jet for heavy buildup. Root cutters for those 
    beautiful Marin oaks that find every pipe joint. We keep at it until it's truly clear.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 4. Test and Advise
    We verify flow is restored, then share tips to prevent future problems.
    If we spotted something concerning during drain service, we'll mention it—but we don't push repairs you don't need.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## 11 PM on a Sunday? We Answer.

    Sewage backing up in Terra Linda before your in-laws arrive? Toilet overflow in Gerstle Park 
    at midnight? We've handled both—and worse. Our trucks stay ready, and we know 
    San Rafael's hills and shortcuts well enough to get there fast.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) any hour. We mean it.**

    ## San Rafael's Unique Drain Challenges

    San Rafael's terrain—from bay-level properties to hillside homes—creates drainage challenges 
    that demand real local expertise. Here's what makes drain cleaning here different:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Hillside Homes
    San Rafael Hill, Dominican, the hills above Terra Linda—gravity works differently up here. 
    Pressure variations, long runs to the main, and drainage that depends on proper slope. 
    We bring the right equipment and know what we're walking into.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Historic Properties
    Gerstle Park and downtown have some of the oldest plumbing in Marin. Cast iron drains, 
    galvanized supply lines, clay laterals with 80 years of root intrusion. 
    We use careful methods that don't destroy what makes these homes special.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bay-Adjacent Properties
    Loch Lomond, Peacock Gap, the Canal—tidal influence affects drainage here. 
    High water tables, saturated soil, and sewer laterals that sit in wet ground year-round. 
    Different challenges than the hills.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Terra Linda
    Mid-century planned community with 1950s-60s infrastructure. Those mature trees 
    planted when the neighborhood was new? Their roots are now finding every pipe joint. 
    We've been working Terra Linda for three generations.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## How to Avoid Calling Us (No Hard Feelings)
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Smart Moves:
    - Strainers in every drain—they cost a few bucks and save hundreds
    - Hot water after the disposal keeps grease moving
    - Deal with slow drains early—they always get worse
    - Annual check-ups if you've had repeat clogs
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Stuff That Causes Problems:
    - Grease down any drain (it hardens and traps everything)
    - "Flushable" wipes (marketing lies—they clog pipes)
    - Store-bought drain chemicals (they corrode your pipes)
    - Pretending that gurgling sound will go away (it won't)
