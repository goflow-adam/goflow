    Pilot light went out? It happens. Relighting it is usually straightforward,
    but gas appliances deserve respect. If anything smells off, sounds wrong,
    or doesn't behave the way it should, stop and [call us](tel:7072008350).

    Here's how to do it safely.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Before You Start

    **Do not attempt to relight the pilot if:**
    * You smell gas strongly
    * You hear hissing near the unit
    * The area feels unusually warm
    * You've already tried and failed multiple times

    If you smell gas, **leave immediately**. Don't flip switches, don't light anything.
    Call your gas utility or [call us](tel:7072008350) from outside.

    If everything smells normal and the area is ventilated, proceed.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## How It Works

    The **pilot light** is a small flame that ignites the main burner when hot water is needed.
    The **gas control valve** has three positions:

    * **OFF** — No gas flows
    * **PILOT** — Gas flows to the pilot only (when you press the knob)
    * **ON** — Normal operation

    When you hold the knob down in PILOT mode, you're manually allowing gas to flow.
    Once the [thermocouple](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-gas-valve/) senses heat from the flame,
    it signals the valve to stay open.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Step-by-Step Instructions
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. Turn to OFF and Wait

    Rotate the control knob to **OFF** and wait 2-3 minutes.
    This lets any residual gas clear from the combustion chamber.
    Skipping this step is how you lose your eyebrows.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 2. Set to PILOT

    Turn the knob to **PILOT**. Check the label on your water heater—if the
    instructions there differ from this guide, follow those.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. Press and Hold the Knob

    Push the knob **all the way in** and hold it.
    This opens gas flow to the pilot. If it's quiet, you might hear a faint hiss.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 4. Access the Pilot

    Remove the combustion chamber cover at the bottom of the water heater.
    It's usually held by clips or a few screws. Set it aside.
    Be careful—internal components may still be hot.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 5. Light It

    While holding the knob down:
    * Use a long lighter or match
    * Insert the flame through the access opening
    * Light the pilot at the tip of the supply tube

    You should see a **steady blue flame**. Yellow or flickering means something's off.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 6. Keep Holding (30-60 Seconds)

    Don't release the knob yet. The thermocouple needs time to heat up
    and generate enough current to keep the gas valve open.
    Count to 60 to be safe.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 7. Release and Check

    Slowly release the knob.
    * **Pilot stays lit** — You're good. Move to step 8.
    * **Pilot goes out** — Wait a few minutes and try again.

    If it won't stay lit after 2-3 attempts, stop. The thermocouple or gas valve
    may need attention. [Give us a call](tel:7072008350).
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 8. Turn to ON

    Turn the control knob to **ON**. Replace the access panel.
    Your water heater should now heat water normally.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## What Success Looks Like

    * Steady blue pilot flame
    * Main burner ignites when you use hot water
    * No gas smell
    * Quiet operation

    If anything seems off, trust your instincts and shut it down.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Why Pilots Won't Stay Lit

    Common causes:
    * **Failing thermocouple** — Most common, cheap to replace
    * **Dust or debris** in the pilot assembly
    * **Drafts** blowing out the flame
    * **Faulty gas control valve**

    All fixable. None require forcing parts to work.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## When to Call Us

    Stop and [call us](tel:7072008350) if:
    * The pilot won't stay lit after multiple attempts
    * You smell gas at any point
    * The flame looks yellow, lazy, or uneven
    * You feel unsure at any step

    We'd rather check it out than have you dealing with something unsafe.
