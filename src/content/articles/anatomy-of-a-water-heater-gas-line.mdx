    Your water heater needs fuel. The gas supply line delivers it—natural gas or propane,
    depending on your setup—from your home's main supply to the burner.
    When everything's connected properly, you never think about it. That's the goal.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Shutoff Valve

    There should be a shutoff valve on the gas line near your water heater.
    It's usually got a brightly colored handle and requires only a quarter turn to operate.

    * **Parallel to the pipe** = gas flowing
    * **Perpendicular to the pipe** = gas off

    This valve lets you cut off the gas supply to the water heater for maintenance, repairs, or emergencies
    without shutting off gas to your whole house.

    **If you don't see a shutoff valve**, [call us](tel:7072008350).
    Some installers skip this step, and that's a problem you want fixed.

  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Line Itself

    A proper gas line installation includes:
    * **Rigid steel pipe** from your home's gas main
    * **A flexible connector** (usually corrugated stainless steel) near the water heater
    * **The shutoff valve** between the two
    <p><img src="/images/water-heater/gas-line.jpg" alt="Water Heater Gas Line" title="Water Heater Gas Line"/></p>
    The flexible section, yellow in the image, is important—it allows for some movement (like in an earthquake) and makes servicing easier.
    If your water heater connects directly to rigid pipe with no flex connector,
    that's something we would love to remedy for you and the safety of your home.

    ## How to Check for Leaks

    The **soapy water test** is simple and safe:

    1. Mix dish soap with water
    2. Apply to gas line connections with a sponge or spray bottle
    3. Watch for bubbles

    Bubbles mean gas is escaping. If you see them, [call us](tel:7072008350).

    Don't rely on smell alone—gas can be diluted by other odors or too faint to detect.
    And never, ever use a flame to check for leaks unless you're auditioning for a
    [Darwin Award](https://darwinawards.com/).

    ## Warning Signs

    Have your gas line checked if you notice:
    * A sulfur or "rotten egg" smell
    * Hissing sounds near the heater
    * A pilot light that won't stay lit
    * Soot or discoloration around the burner

    These don't always mean disaster, but they deserve professional attention.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## If You Smell Gas

    Don't mess around with this:

    1. Don't flip any electrical switches
    2. Don't light anything
    3. Leave the area calmly
    4. Contact your gas provider or call 911 from outside
    5. Once safe, arrange for a professional inspection

    Your safety comes first. Always.
