    Keeping your drains clear is essential for maintaining a healthy plumbing system.
    To avoid clogs and costly repairs, it's important to know what shouldn't go down your sinks and drains.

    ### Grease and Cooking Oils
    These substances may seem harmless in liquid form, but they cool and harden inside your pipes,
    leading to stubborn clogs.

    ### Coffee Grounds
    Often mistaken for easily washable waste, coffee grounds clump together in pipes,
    forming dense blockages.

    ### Food Scraps
    Even small food particles can build up over time and clog your kitchen sink drain.

    ### Hair and Soap Scum
    In bathroom drains, hair and soap residue often combine to create difficult-to-clear clogs.

    ### Flushable Wipes
    Despite their name, flushable wipes don't break down like toilet paper and frequently clog sewer lines. They also catch on the inside of pipes in older homes creating buildup that eventually becomes a blockage.

    ### Squirrels
    These are never a good idea to flush down the drain. Many people believe that if the squirrel is still alive, it will find its way out to the ocean with the rest of their friends, but this just is not the case.
