  ### That drip is more than annoying—it's costing you

    A leaking faucet wastes water, drives you crazy, and can damage your counters and cabinets
    if it's leaking at the base. Whether it's your kitchen faucet dripping into the sink or
    your bathroom faucet that won't stop, we'll find the cause and fix it right.

    Need a new faucet installed? We handle that too—kitchen faucets, bathroom faucets,
    bathtub faucets, even shower faucets. We're your faucet plumber.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** and we'll get your faucet sorted out.

    ## What to Do Right Now

    Before we arrive:

    - **Dripping faucet?** It can wait, but don't ignore it—a drip wastes gallons per day.
    - **Leak at the base or under the sink?** Turn off the angle stops (shutoff valves under the sink).
    - **Can't stop the leak?** Shut off water to the house and call us.
    - **Don't over-tighten handles** — Most leaks come from worn parts, not "not tight enough."

    If you're considering an upgrade while we're there:

  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Kitchen Faucet Problems We Fix

    Your kitchen faucet gets more use than any other faucet in the house.
    No wonder it's often the first to have problems.

    - **Dripping** — Worn cartridge, O-rings, or valve seat. We'll diagnose which.
    - **Leak at base** — Failed O-ring or loose connections. Can damage countertops.
    - **Low pressure** — Clogged aerator, supply line issue, or cartridge problem.
    - **Sprayer not working** — Diverter valve, hose, or sprayer head issue.
    - **Hard to turn** — Mineral buildup or worn cartridge.
    - **Loose handle** — Usually a simple tightening or set screw replacement.

    We install kitchen faucets from all major brands—Moen, Delta, Kohler, Pfister, and others.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Kitchen Faucet Installation

    Installing a new kitchen faucet involves:

    - **Removing the old faucet** — Including supply lines and mounting hardware.
    - **Checking supply lines** — Replacing if corroded or kinked.
    - **Installing the new faucet** — Proper mounting and sealing.
    - **Connecting supply lines** — With new supply lines if needed.
    - **Testing** — Checking for leaks and proper operation.

    If you've bought a faucet, we can install it. If you need recommendations,
    we can help you choose based on your sink, style, and budget.

    Most kitchen faucet installations take 1-2 hours.

    ## Bathroom Faucet Repair & Installation
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bathroom Sink Faucets

    Bathroom faucets see daily use and eventually wear out.

    **Common problems:**
    - **Dripping** — Same causes as kitchen faucets. Worn internal parts.
    - **Leak at base** — O-ring failure or loose mounting.
    - **Low pressure** — Clogged aerator or supply issue.
    - **Hard to turn** — Mineral buildup, especially in hard water areas.
    - **Hot/cold reversed** — Installation issue or cartridge problem.

    We service all bathroom faucet styles—single-handle, two-handle, widespread,
    and wall-mounted. We're your plumber for leaking faucet issues in the bathroom.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bathtub Faucets

    Bathtub faucet repair is a bit different—the plumbing is often in the wall.

    **What we fix:**
    - **Dripping tub spout** — Valve cartridge or seat issue.
    - **Leak behind wall** — Requires access, but we minimize damage.
    - **Diverter not working** — Water won't go to showerhead.
    - **Hard to turn handles** — Worn stems or cartridges.
    - **Low pressure** — Supply issue or valve problem.

    We install bathtub faucets during remodels or when replacement is needed.
    If you need to replace an old two-handle with a single-handle, we can do that too.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Shower Faucets

    When people say "shower faucet," they usually mean the valve and handles
    that control the shower. We know what you mean, and we fix them.

    **Common shower faucet issues:**
    - **Dripping when off** — Valve cartridge needs replacement.
    - **Temperature won't stay consistent** — Pressure-balancing valve issue.
    - **Hard to turn** — Worn cartridge or mineral buildup.
    - **Leak in wall** — Requires access panel or wall opening.
    - **Won't switch from tub to shower** — Diverter problem.

    We're your plumber to replace shower faucet valves and handles.
    If you're updating your shower, we can install new trim and valves.

    ## Faucet Repair vs. Replacement
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### When Repair Makes Sense

    - **Newer faucet** — If it's less than 5-7 years old, repair usually makes sense.
    - **Quality brand** — Good faucets are worth repairing.
    - **Simple fix** — Cartridge, O-ring, or aerator replacement.
    - **Parts available** — We can get the parts.
    - **You like the faucet** — Style and function work for you.

    Most faucet repairs are straightforward and cost less than replacement.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### When Replacement Makes Sense

    - **Old faucet** — If it's 10+ years old and failing, replace it.
    - **Cheap faucet** — Some aren't worth repairing.
    - **Parts unavailable** — Discontinued models can be hard to fix.
    - **Multiple problems** — If several things are failing, replace.
    - **You want an upgrade** — New faucets have better features and efficiency.
    - **Corrosion or damage** — Some damage can't be repaired.

    We'll tell you honestly which situation you're in. We don't push replacements
    when a $50 repair will solve the problem.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## What Affects Pricing

    We give upfront pricing before any work begins. Here's what affects the quote:

    - **Repair vs. replace** — Repairs are generally less expensive.
    - **Type of faucet** — Kitchen, bathroom, tub, or shower.
    - **Access** — Bathroom sink is easy. Tub valve in the wall takes longer.
    - **Parts needed** — Cartridges, supply lines, mounting hardware.
    - **Faucet cost** — If replacing, the faucet itself varies widely in price.

    **Typical timeframes:**
    - Simple repair (cartridge, aerator): 30-60 minutes
    - Kitchen or bathroom faucet installation: 1-2 hours
    - Bathtub faucet replacement: 2-4 hours
    - Shower valve replacement: 2-4 hours (depends on access)
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Keeping Your Faucets Working

    **Extend faucet life:**
    - **Don't over-tighten handles** — Turn off gently. Forcing causes wear.
    - **Clean aerators** — Unscrew and rinse periodically to maintain flow.
    - **Address drips early** — A small drip becomes a big repair if ignored.
    - **Use quality parts** — When we repair, we use parts that last.

    **Hard water areas:**
    - Mineral buildup is the enemy of faucets.
    - Consider a water softener if you're replacing faucets frequently.
    - Clean aerators more often.

    ## Frequently Asked Questions
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### How much does it cost to fix a leaking faucet?

    Depends on the faucet and the problem. A simple cartridge replacement
    is less expensive than replacing the whole faucet. We give upfront pricing
    before starting any work.

    ### Can you install a faucet I already bought?

    Yes. We're happy to install faucets you've purchased.
    Just make sure it's compatible with your sink (number of holes, spacing).
    If you're not sure, we can check before you buy.

    ### How long do faucets last?

    Quality faucets last 15-20 years. Cheaper faucets may only last 5-10.
    Hard water and heavy use shorten lifespan. If yours is old and having
    problems, replacement often makes more sense than repair.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Why does my faucet drip after I turn it off?

    Usually a worn cartridge, washer, or valve seat. The internal parts
    that seal the water flow wear out over time. This is the most common
    faucet repair we do.

    ### Can you replace a two-handle faucet with a single-handle?

    Usually yes, but it depends on your sink or tub configuration.
    For sinks, you may need a deck plate to cover extra holes.
    For tubs, it's more involved but often possible.

    ### Do you work on outdoor faucets?

    Yes. Outdoor faucets (hose bibs) leak, freeze, and break.
    We repair and replace them. If you're in a freeze-prone area,
    we can install frost-free hose bibs.
