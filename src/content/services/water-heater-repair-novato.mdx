    and let us fix your hot water relationship or give you a water heater
    that gives you what you need in this relationship.

    Novato's housing spans decades—1940s military housing at Hamilton, vintage Old Town cottages,
    modern San Marin developments. Each era brought different water heater setups and challenges.
    We've worked on all of them, and we know what each requires.

    ## What to Do While You Wait
    1. **You've called us at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—good. We're coming.
    2. Water spreading? Find the valve on top of the tank and turn it clockwise to stop the flow.
    3. Gas smell? Everyone out of the house. Call PG&E from outside.
    4. Tank cracked and leaking from the body? Don't run hot water—it accelerates the damage.

    Sit tight. We know Novato's streets and we'll be there soon.

    ## Working in Your Novato Home

    We treat your home like we're guests—because we are. Drop cloths protect your floors.
    Shoe covers go on at the door. When we leave, you won't find a trace we were there
    except for the working water heater.

    Novato's housing history is written in its water heaters. Hamilton Field homes from the 1940s
    have compact utility closets and older gas lines. Old Town cottages have their own quirks.
    San Marin's newer builds use modern systems but connect to aging city infrastructure.
    We've worked in all of them and know what each situation requires.

    Marin County permits? We handle the paperwork and schedule the inspection.
    You focus on your day; we focus on your hot water.

    ## Matching the Right Water Heater Repair to Your Novato Home

    Hamilton's 1940s utility closets need different solutions than San Marin's modern garages.
    Here's what we install and when each makes sense:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Traditional Tanks
    Dependable and affordable. Gas, electric, or hybrid in 30-80 gallon sizes.
    **Space matters in Novato:** Hamilton homes often have tight utility areas—we carry
    compact models that fit where standard units won't. With regular maintenance,
    expect 8-12 years of reliable service.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tankless (On-Demand)
    Wall-mounted, space-saving, energy efficient, and endless hot water. Ideal for Novato homes where
    the utility closet is already cramped or where a growing family needs more capacity.
    20+ year lifespan, 30% energy savings. Gas line and venting upgrades required—we handle those.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Heat Pump Water Heaters
    Extract heat from ambient air—2-3x more efficient than standard tanks.
    Marin's mild climate is perfect for these units. They need some space around them
    to work properly, so they're better suited to San Marin garages than Hamilton closets.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Comparing Your Options

    | System | Upfront | Energy Savings | Lifespan | Space Required |
    |--------|---------|----------------|----------|----------------|
    | Tank | $ | Moderate | 8-12 yrs | Standard |
    | Tankless | $$$ | High (30%) | 20+ yrs | Minimal |
    | Heat Pump | $$$ | Very High | 10-15 yrs | Medium |
    | Solar | $$$$ | Maximum | 20+ yrs | Roof + tank |
