    ### Only Leak Solutions We Would Offer Our Own Mom

    You suspect a leak. Maybe your water bill spiked, you hear water running when nothing's on,
    or there's a damp spot that shouldn't be there. Hidden leaks cause real damage—mold, rot,
    foundation problems—and the longer they go undetected, the worse it gets.

    We find leaks others miss. Using acoustic detection, thermal imaging, and pressure testing,
    we pinpoint exactly where the problem is before cutting into anything.
    Then we fix it right.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** and we'll find your leak.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Signs You Might Have a Leak

    Not sure if you have a leak? Here's what to watch for:

    - **Unexplained water bill increase** — The most common first sign
    - **Sound of running water** when nothing is on
    - **Damp spots** on walls, ceilings, or floors
    - **Musty smell** — Hidden moisture breeds mold
    - **Warm spots on the floor** — Could be a hot water line under the slab
    - **Cracks in foundation** — Water undermines concrete over time
    - **Low water pressure** — Water is going somewhere it shouldn't

    If you notice any of these, call us. The sooner we find it, the less damage you'll have.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## Types of Leaks We Find and Fix
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Hidden Pipe Leaks

    Leaks inside walls, under floors, or above ceilings. You might not see them,
    but you'll notice the damage eventually—water stains, peeling paint, soft drywall.

    **Common causes:**
    - Pinhole corrosion in copper pipes
    - Failed joints or fittings
    - Freeze damage (rare here, but it happens)
    - Age and wear

    We use acoustic detection and thermal imaging to find these without tearing up your walls.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Slab Leaks

    Leaks in the pipes running under your concrete foundation. These are serious—they can
    undermine your foundation and cause major structural damage if left unaddressed.

    **Signs of a slab leak:**
    - Warm or damp spots on the floor
    - Sound of running water from below
    - Cracks in flooring or foundation
    - Unexplained high water bills

    Slab leak detection requires specialized equipment. We have it.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Underground Leaks

    Leaks in your main water line or irrigation system. Often show up as soggy spots
    in the yard, unusually green patches, or a water bill that doesn't make sense.

    We use pressure testing and acoustic detection to locate underground leaks
    without digging up your entire yard.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Fixture and Supply Line Leaks

    Leaks at toilets, faucets, water heaters, and supply connections.
    These are often visible but sometimes hide behind walls or under cabinets.

    **Common culprits:**
    - Toilet tank or base leaks
    - Supply line failures (especially braided steel hoses)
    - Water heater connections
    - Washing machine hoses

    These are usually straightforward to fix once we identify the source.

    ## How We Find Your Leak
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Our Detection Process

    1. **We listen first** — You know your home. We ask what you've noticed and when.
    2. **Visual inspection** — Checking for obvious signs and likely locations.
    3. **Pressure testing** — Isolating sections to narrow down the location.
    4. **Acoustic detection** — Listening for the sound of water escaping.
    5. **Thermal imaging** — Finding temperature differences that indicate hidden moisture.
    6. **Moisture meters** — Confirming water presence in walls and floors.
    7. **Camera inspection** — When we need to see inside pipes.

    We use the right tool for the situation—not every leak needs every method.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Why Detection Matters

    Finding the leak accurately before cutting into anything saves you money.
    A plumber who guesses wrong will cut holes in your wall, not find the leak,
    and cut more holes. You pay for the damage and the repair.

    We invest in detection equipment because it's the right way to do the job.
    We find the leak first, then make one precise access point to fix it.

    **The goal:** Minimum damage, maximum accuracy.

    ### Repair Options

    Once we find the leak, we explain your options:

    - **Spot repair** — Fixing the specific leak point. Best when the rest of the pipe is in good shape.
    - **Section replacement** — Replacing a damaged section of pipe. Good for localized corrosion.
    - **Repiping** — Replacing entire pipe runs. Recommended when pipes are failing systemically.
    - **Epoxy lining** — Internal pipe coating for certain situations (not always appropriate).

    We'll tell you honestly which option makes sense for your situation.
    A spot repair on a pipe that's corroding throughout is just delaying the inevitable.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### After the Repair

    - **Pressure testing** — Verifying the repair holds
    - **Documentation** — What we found, what we did, photos if needed for insurance
    - **Prevention advice** — What to watch for, how to prevent future leaks
    - **Warranty** — We stand behind our work

    If the leak caused water damage, we can recommend restoration contractors we trust.
    We don't do restoration ourselves, but we know who does it right.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## What Affects Pricing

    We give upfront pricing before any work begins. Here's what affects the quote:

    - **Detection complexity** — Simple fixture leak vs. hidden slab leak
    - **Access** — Is the pipe easy to reach or buried in a wall/slab?
    - **Repair type** — Spot repair vs. section replacement vs. repiping
    - **Pipe material** — Copper, PEX, galvanized, CPVC all have different repair approaches
    - **Urgency** — Active leaks causing damage need immediate attention

    **Typical timeframes:**
    - Leak detection: 1-3 hours depending on complexity
    - Simple repair: 1-2 hours
    - Section replacement: 2-4 hours
    - Repiping: 1-3 days depending on scope
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Preventing Future Leaks

    **Regular checks:**
    - Inspect under sinks and around toilets monthly
    - Check water heater connections annually
    - Replace washing machine hoses every 5 years
    - Know where your main shutoff is (and test it annually)

    **Warning signs to watch:**
    - Any unexplained increase in water bill
    - Sounds of running water when nothing is on
    - Musty smells in cabinets or closets
    - Stains on ceilings or walls

    Catching leaks early saves thousands in damage repair.

    ## Frequently Asked Questions
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### How do I know if I have a hidden leak?

    The most common sign is an unexplained increase in your water bill.
    Other signs: sounds of running water when nothing is on, damp spots,
    musty smells, or warm spots on the floor (hot water line leak).

    ### How long does leak detection take?

    Simple leaks: under an hour. Complex hidden leaks or slab leaks: 2-3 hours.
    We take the time to find it accurately rather than guess and cut holes.

    ### Will you have to tear up my walls or floors?

    Our goal is minimum damage. We use detection equipment to pinpoint the leak
    before making any access cuts. One precise hole beats ten exploratory ones.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### How much does leak detection cost?

    It depends on complexity. A simple pressure test is different from
    a full slab leak investigation with thermal imaging. We give you pricing
    before we start, and detection is often included if we do the repair.

    ### Can you fix the leak the same day you find it?

    Usually, yes. We come prepared for common repairs. Complex situations
    (like repiping or slab repairs) may require scheduling follow-up work.

    ### What if the leak is under my foundation?

    Slab leaks are serious but fixable. Options include tunneling under the slab,
    cutting through the slab, or rerouting the pipe. We'll explain the pros and cons
    of each approach for your specific situation.
  </div>

    ## Stop the Leak Before It Stops You

    Hidden leaks don't fix themselves—they get worse. The water damage, mold,
    and structural problems that follow cost far more than finding and fixing the leak now.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** and we'll find your leak.
