faqs:
  - question: Is a slow drain an emergency?
    answer: >-
      Not always, but it's a warning sign. A slow drain can turn into a backup
      quickly (especially if multiple fixtures are affected). If you're seeing
      water rise, gurgling, or recurring clogs, call us and we'll help you
      decide what to do next.
  - question: Should I use chemical drain cleaner?
    answer: >-
      We generally don't recommend it. Many chemical cleaners can damage pipes
      and make the problem harder (and messier) to fix. If you want to try
      something safe, we can talk you through simple first steps and then
      schedule service if needed.
  - question: Do you use cameras or hydro-jetting?
    answer: >-
      Yes. When it's helpful, we use video camera inspection to see what's
      actually happening, and hydro-jetting to clear buildup and restore full
      flow—not just punch a hole through a clog.
  - question: What do you do to keep the home clean during drain work?
    answer: >-
      We protect the work area, work clean, and fully clean up. If we use a
      camera or need to open a cleanout, we'll explain what we're doing before
      we do it.
  - question: Do you offer same-day drain cleaning in Santa Rosa?
    answer: >-
      In many cases, yes—especially for active backups and no-drain situations.
      Call us and we'll give you a clear arrival window.
  - question: Do you provide emergency drain cleaning in Santa Rosa CA?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Sewer backups and drain emergencies don't wait for business hours.
      Call us and we'll give you a clear arrival window. Santa Rosa is our
      home base—we can get there fast.
  - question: What Santa Rosa drain services do you offer?
    answer: >-
      We handle drain clearing, rooter service, camera inspection, hydro-jetting,
      drain repair, and drain replacement in Santa Rosa. Whether it's a simple
      clog or a collapsed line, we diagnose the cause and fix it right.

    ## Why Santa Rosa Trusts Us

    We don't just unclog drains—we fix them so they stay fixed. When we pack up and leave, 
    you shouldn't have to think about that drain again for years.

    **We've watched this city evolve.** Three generations of our family have worked here.
    We are now the Santa Rosa drain services neighbors rely on.
    Through the fires and the rebuilds. We've adapted as the infrastructure changed,
    and we understand things other plumbers miss—like why a Fountaingrove rebuild might have
    issues where new plumbing meets old city lines.

    **We know every neighborhood.** The cast iron in Railroad Square. The galvanized steel in Roseland.
    The clay soil in Bennett Valley. The brand-new systems in Coffey Park. Each requires a different approach.

    **Honest pricing, always.** The number we quote is the number you pay. No surprise line items.
    That's the kind of customer service that keeps Santa Rosa homeowners coming back.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's get your drains working.**

    - Sink full of standing water
    - Dishwasher water coming back up

    - Years of grease finally catching up
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">

    ## Our Process: No Guessing, Just Results

    Santa Rosa's mix of old and new plumbing means we can't afford to guess. Here's how we actually work:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. Assess the Situation
    We run water, check fixtures, and listen to your plumbing systems. One clog or a main line problem?
    Cameras go in when we need to see what's happening deep in the line.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 2. Explain Before We Act
    You'll know what's happening and what it costs before we start.
    Plain English. No pressure. You decide what makes sense.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. Get It Cleared
    Cable machines for routine clogs. Hydro jetting for serious buildup. 
    Root cutters for those Bennett Valley oaks. We keep at it until it's done.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 4. Verify and Advise
    We confirm everything's flowing, then share tips to keep it that way.
    If we spotted something concerning, we'll mention it—but we don't push repairs you don't need.
  </div>

    ## What Makes Santa Rosa Drain Cleaning Different

    As Sonoma County's largest city, Santa Rosa has the most varied plumbing infrastructure in the region.
    Here's what makes a clogged drain in Santa Rosa different:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Fire-Affected Areas
    Fountaingrove, Coffey Park, Mark West Springs—the 2017 fires changed everything. 
    Brand-new plumbing connecting to decades-old city infrastructure. We understand 
    where these systems meet and why problems happen at the connection points.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Historic Neighborhoods
    Railroad Square, McDonald Avenue, Cherry Street—some of the oldest plumbing in Sonoma County.
    Century-old cast iron, original drain systems, heritage homes that need careful techniques.
    We don't destroy what makes these homes special.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bennett Valley & the Hills
    Clay-heavy soil that stresses pipes and encourages root intrusion. Those beautiful oaks?
    Their roots are finding every pipe joint. Hillside drainage that depends on proper slope.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Roseland & Established Areas
    Working-class neighborhoods with aging galvanized infrastructure. Mid-century homes 
    with 50-60 year old drain systems. Montgomery Village, Southwest Santa Rosa—
    we've been working these areas for three generations.
  </div>

  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Smart Moves:
    - Strainers on every drain—they cost a few bucks and save hundreds
    - Hot water flush after running the disposal
    - Deal with slow drains before they become no-drains
    - Maintenance visits if clogs keep coming back (we highly recommend this for older homes)
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Stuff That Causes Problems:
    - Grease in any drain (it coats pipes and catches everything)
    - "Flushable" wipes (marketing lies—they clog pipes)
    - Chemical drain cleaners (they dissolve your pipes too)
    - Hoping that gurgling sound fixes itself (spoiler: it won't)
