### A clogged drain is annoying—until it becomes a mess.

Maybe a crazed squirrel crawled in or some kid shoved their favorite lego creation in your
      toilet or maybe that beautiful tree has taken a liking to the liquid inside your sewer line.
      Whatever it is, we will find your [clogged drain problem](/articles/clogged-drains-service-advice/) and clear it.
      Our technicians are armed with night vision, cameras, and squirrel traps.
      Give us a call so we can get your drains cleared, unclogged, and flowing again.

If you want to understand what’s going on before we arrive, start here:

<div class="two-column">
## What to Do Right Now

- If water is rising or threatening to overflow, stop using that fixture.
- If multiple drains are backing up at once, that can signal a main line issue.
- Avoid chemical drain cleaners—they often don’t solve the problem and can make repairs harder.

If it’s urgent, call us: [707-200-8350](tel:7072008350)

### Long-Term Fixes (Not Just “Clear Enough”)

We’ll tell you what we found and what it means.
If you need a simple cleanout today and a bigger plan later, we’ll map that out clearly.
