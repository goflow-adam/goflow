    Here's something we hear a lot: "I want to save water, but I don't want a weak shower."

    Fair. Nobody wants to stand under a sad trickle wondering if the shampoo is ever going to rinse out.
    The good news? Modern water-efficient fixtures have come a long way.
    You can use less water and still have a shower that actually feels like a shower.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Real Problem with Old Plumbing

    Many Marin homes were built when water was cheap and nobody thought twice about a 5-gallon-per-minute showerhead.
    Those systems weren't designed for today's reality—multiple showers running at once,
    modern appliances, and the general expectation that hot water should arrive *now*, not eventually.

    When you upgrade to efficient fixtures without addressing the underlying plumbing,
    you often get the worst of both worlds: less water *and* less comfort.
    That's not efficiency. That's just disappointment.

    The trick is matching the right fixtures to properly designed plumbing.
    When both work together, you get consistent pressure, steady temperatures, and lower water bills.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Showers That Don't Feel Like Compromise

    Modern showerheads use smarter spray patterns and pressure optimization instead of just blasting more water at you.
    Systems like **[Kohler's WaterSense Shower Heads](https://www.kohler.com/en/products/showers/shop-watersense-shower-heads)**
    meet [WaterSense efficiency standards](https://www.epa.gov/watersense)
    while still delivering coverage that feels full and satisfying.

    The difference is engineering. Instead of relying on volume, these fixtures focus on
    how water is distributed—better coverage, consistent pressure, no cold spots.

    We've installed plenty of these. The most common reaction after the first shower? "Wait, this is the low-flow one?"
  </div>

    ## Toilets That Actually Work

    Old low-flow toilets earned their bad reputation. They often required multiple flushes,
    which defeated the whole point.

    Newer designs like the **[Niagara Stealth](https://pro.niagaracorp.com/products/?type=toilets&technology=stealth-technology)**
    use vacuum-assisted flushing to move waste efficiently with minimal water.
    One flush. Done. Quiet, too.

    When a toilet works well, you don't think about it. That's the goal.

    ## Getting Hot Water Faster (Without Wasting It)

    Here's a hidden source of water waste: waiting for hot water to arrive.

    If your bathroom is 50 feet from your water heater, you might run the faucet for a minute or more
    before the water warms up. That's gallons down the drain every single time—and it adds up fast.

    A few strategies can fix this:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Recirculation Pumps

    A **recirculation pump** keeps hot water moving through your pipes so it's ready when you need it.
    Modern versions are smart about it—they learn your usage patterns and only run when you're likely
    to need hot water, not 24/7.

    For homes with a traditional tank water heater, this is often the most cost-effective upgrade.
    Hot water arrives almost instantly, and you stop wasting gallons waiting for it.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Point-of-Use Tankless Heaters

    For bathrooms that are far from the main water heater, a small **tankless water heater**
    installed near the bathroom can make a big difference. It heats water on demand right where you need it.

    This works especially well for guest bathrooms, additions, or any space where running new hot water lines
    would be expensive or impractical. No waiting, no wasted water.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Location Matters

    Sometimes the simplest solution is proximity. If you're planning a remodel or addition,
    think about where the bathroom sits relative to your water heater.

    A bathroom close to the water heater gets hot water fast. One at the far end of the house?
    That's where you start looking at recirculation or point-of-use solutions.

    We can help you think through what makes sense for your layout.

  <div class="two-column">
    ## What's Behind the Walls Matters

    Even the best fixtures can't overcome bad plumbing. Undersized pipes, poor pressure regulation,
    or inadequate venting will undermine any upgrade.

    When we help customers plan bathroom updates, we look at the whole system:
    * Is the pipe sizing adequate for the fixtures you want?
    * Is pressure consistent throughout the house?
    * Are there opportunities to reduce hot water wait times?

    Getting this right means your new fixtures perform the way they're supposed to.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Older Homes, Modern Expectations

    A lot of Marin homes have character—and plumbing that's showing its age.
    Updating doesn't mean losing that character. It means making the infrastructure
    work for how you actually live today.

    Sometimes that's a full bathroom remodel. Sometimes it's just swapping fixtures
    and adjusting a few things behind the walls. We can help you figure out what makes sense.

    ## The Bottom Line

    Water efficiency doesn't have to mean sacrifice.
    With the right fixtures and proper plumbing to support them,
    you can have a bathroom that feels great *and* uses less water.
