faqs:
  - question: "Is a slow drain an emergency?"
    answer: "Not always, but it’s a warning sign. A slow drain can turn into a backup quickly (especially if multiple fixtures are affected). If you’re seeing water rise, gurgling, or recurring clogs, call us and we’ll help you decide what to do next."
  - question: "Should I use chemical drain cleaner?"
    answer: "We generally don’t recommend it. Many chemical cleaners can damage pipes and make the problem harder (and messier) to fix. If you want to try something safe, we can talk you through simple first steps and then schedule service if needed."
  - question: "Do you use cameras or hydro-jetting?"
    answer: "Yes. When it’s helpful, we use video camera inspection to see what’s actually happening, and hydro-jetting to clear buildup and restore full flow—not just punch a hole through a clog."
  - question: "What do you do to keep the home clean during drain work?"
    answer: "We protect the work area, work clean, and fully clean up. If we use a camera or need to open a cleanout, we’ll explain what we’re doing before we do it."
  - question: "Do you offer same-day drain cleaning in Santa Rosa?"
    answer: "In many cases, yes—especially for active backups and no-drain situations. Call us and we’ll give you a clear arrival window."

    ## What to Do Right Now (Before We Arrive)

    - If there’s an active overflow, stop using water in that area and move anything nearby that could be damaged.
    - If multiple fixtures are backing up, it may be a main line issue—avoid running sinks/showers until it’s inspected.
    - Skip chemical drain cleaners; they can damage pipes and make service harder.
