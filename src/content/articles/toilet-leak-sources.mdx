A leaking toilet isn't just an annoyance—it can waste hundreds of gallons of water and potentially cause serious damage to your home. Understanding where toilet leaks commonly occur can help you identify problems early and get them fixed before they become major issues.

## How to Identify Common Toilet Leak Sources

### 1. Base of the Toilet
When water pools around the base of your toilet, it could indicate:

### 2. Tank-to-Bowl Connection
Leaks between the tank and bowl often result from:
- Worn out rubber gasket
- Loose mounting bolts
- Cracked tank
- Deteriorated spud washer

### 3. Supply Line
Water line leaks can occur due to:
- Loose connections
- Worn out supply line
- Corroded shut-off valve

## Common Leak Types

### 1. Supply Line Leaks
The supply line connects your home's water source to the toilet's tank. Over time, these flexible hoses can develop cracks or loose connections, resulting in water pooling around the base of the toilet. A damaged supply line can often be replaced quickly, but if overlooked, it may cause significant water damage.

### 2. Angle Stop Leaks
The angle stop, or shut-off valve, is the small valve that controls water flow to your toilet. Leaks here are typically caused by worn seals or corrosion. GoFlow Plumbing specializes in repairing or replacing faulty angle stops to restore your toilet's water control without further risk of leaks.

### 3. Tank-to-Bowl Seal Leaks
The connection between the toilet tank and bowl relies on a rubber gasket that can wear down over time. If you notice water dripping from this area, that seal may need replacement. GoFlow Plumbing's experts can assess and replace worn seals efficiently, ensuring a secure, leak-free connection.

### 4. Base Leaks (Wax Ring Failure)
A leak at the base of your toilet often points to a failing wax ring — the crucial seal that prevents water from escaping where your toilet meets the drain. This type of leak requires the toilet to be carefully removed and reseated, a process GoFlow Plumbing handles with precision and care.
