# General Service Pages Content Framework

> **The Core Question Every General Service Page Must Answer:**
> *"What is this service, how do you do it, and why should I trust you to do it?"*

This framework applies to service pages that are **not** city-specific, such as `water-heater-repair-and-replacement.mdx`, `sewer-line-repair-and-replacement.mdx`, and `leak-detection-and-repair.mdx`. For city-specific service pages, see [ServicePagesFramework.md](./ServicePagesFramework.md).

## Primary Purpose: SEO + Conversion

**General service pages have two jobs:**

1. **SEO** — Rank for broad service keywords ("water heater repair," "sewer line replacement")
2. **Conversion** — Convert the visitor who is already on the page looking at the service they need

The visitor is already on your site, already looking at the service they need. **Convert them now.** Don't treat these pages as a waystation to somewhere else.

City-specific service pages are available as an option for visitors who want local detail, but getting visitors to those pages is not the purpose of general service pages.

## How General Service Pages Differ from City-Specific Service Pages

| City-Specific Service Pages | General Service Pages |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Focus: "How do you solve this problem *in my city*?" | Focus: "What is this service and how do you do it?" |
| Content: Local challenges, neighborhoods, permits | Content: Service overview, methodology, expertise |
| SEO target: "[service] [city]" keywords | SEO target: Broad "[service]" keywords |
| Unique sections: City-specific FAQs, local codes | Unique sections: Service comparisons, technology, process |
| Conversion: Local trust signals | Conversion: Expertise and process trust signals |

**Both page types should convert.** The difference is what trust signals resonate:
- City pages: "We know your neighborhood"
- General pages: "We know this service inside and out"

### The Relationship Between Page Types

```
General Service Page (broad SEO, converts on expertise)
    ├── City-Specific Service Pages (local SEO, converts on local knowledge)
    └── Region Pages (geographic hub, all services in area)
```

**Example:**
- `/water-heater-repair-and-replacement/` — Ranks for "water heater repair," converts visitors seeking the service
  - `/water-heater-repair-novato/` — Ranks for "water heater repair Novato," converts with local expertise
  - `/water-heater-repair-san-rafael/` — Ranks for "water heater repair San Rafael," converts with local expertise
- `/novato-plumbing/` — All plumbing services in Novato
- `/san-rafael-plumbing/` — All plumbing services in San Rafael

---

## Core Principle: Speak to the Specific Service

**Every service page should speak to that specific service, not plumbing in general.**

A water heater page should talk about water heaters—not "plumbing problems." A sewer line page should talk about sewer lines—not "your home's systems."

This principle applies even more strongly to general service pages because they need to establish topical authority for that service category.

**Examples:**

| Too Generic | Service-Specific |
|-------------|------------------|
| "We fix plumbing problems" | "We fix water heaters that won't heat, leak, or make strange noises" |
| "Our plumbers are experienced" | "We've replaced thousands of thermocouples and gas valves" |
| "Quality plumbing service" | "Sewer line repair that actually solves the problem—not just a temporary fix" |
| "We handle all your plumbing needs" | "From video inspection to trenchless replacement, we handle every sewer line issue" |

---

## Page Structure & Section Ordering

**Structure for SEO and conversion.** The visitor has a problem and is evaluating whether to call you.

### Recommended Section Order

| Position | Content Type | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| 1 | **Empathy intro + CTA** — Acknowledge their situation, invite action | Builds connection, offers immediate conversion |
| 2 | **Image** | Visual trust signal |
| 3 | **Immediate steps** — What to do right now if urgent | Helps them, shows expertise |
| 4 | **What we repair/service** — Comprehensive list | Answers "can you help me?" |
| 5 | **Our methodology** — How we diagnose and fix | Shows professionalism and expertise |
| 6 | **Repair vs. replacement** — When each makes sense | Builds trust through honest guidance |
| 7 | **Why choose us** — Trust signals, differentiators | Conversion content |
| 8 | **Types/options** — Different systems, technologies | Educational, SEO depth |
| 9 | **Where we serve** — Service area + links to city pages | Geographic relevance, optional deeper content |
| 10 | **Final CTA** — Clear next step | Conversion |

### Why This Order Works

- **CTA early** — Don't make them scroll to find the phone number
- Empathy shows you understand their situation
- Immediate steps help urgent visitors and demonstrate expertise
- Comprehensive service list establishes you can handle their specific issue
- Methodology demonstrates expertise
- Repair vs. replacement shows you're not just pushing sales
- City-specific links are available but not the goal

## The GoFlow Personality on General Service Pages

The same voice principles apply as all other pages. **No extra educational tone.** Every page—general service, city-specific, region—should blend education with conversion. The goal is always to help the visitor and convert them to a caller.

### Open with Empathy + a Light Touch

Acknowledge their situation without being grim:

**Too formal:**
> "We provide comprehensive water heater repair services for residential and commercial clients."

**Too casual:**
> "Water heater busted? We got you."

**Just right:**
> "No hot water is more than an inconvenience. Your water heater is acting up—leaking, not heating, or acting unpredictably. It's messing with your home life and we want to be the ones to put it right."

### Use Storytelling When Appropriate

General service pages have room for brief stories that illustrate expertise or approach:

> "Let me tell you a little clogged sewer line story. I was 11 and standing in a San Francisco garage underneath a sewer line running across the garage ceiling..."

Stories humanize the company and make technical content memorable.

### Voice Characteristics

Same as all GoFlow pages:
- **Conversational** — write like you're talking to a neighbor
- **Playful** — humor is welcome
- **Honest** — willing to say "repair makes more sense than replacement here"
- **Confident but not arrogant** — we're good at this, but we're not bragging
- **Helpful** — explain things clearly, but always with conversion in mind
- **Action-oriented** — every section should move toward the call

## Content Categories for General Service Pages

### 1. Problem Types / What We Service

Comprehensive list of issues you handle for this service category. More exhaustive than city-specific pages.

**Water Heater Example:**
- Tank water heaters (gas, electric, hybrid)
- Tankless water heaters (gas, electric)
- Heat pump water heaters
- Solar water heaters
- Commercial water heaters

**For each type, cover:**
- Common problems you repair
- When repair makes sense
- When replacement makes sense
- What to expect from the service call

### 2. Methodology / How We Work

Explain your diagnostic and repair process. This builds trust and sets expectations.

**Structure:**
1. Initial assessment (what we ask, what we check)
2. Diagnosis (tools we use, how we identify the problem)
3. Options presentation (how we explain findings and choices)
4. Repair/installation process (what happens, how long it takes)
5. Verification (how we confirm the fix worked)
6. Follow-up (warranties, maintenance recommendations)

### 3. Common Repairs (Service-Specific)

List actual repairs with brief explanations. This demonstrates expertise and helps customers identify their issue.

**Water Heater Common Repairs:**
- **Thermocouple replacement** — The #1 reason pilot lights won't stay lit
- **Gas valve replacement** — When the thermocouple isn't the problem
- **Heating element replacement** — Electric water heaters, upper or lower
- **Thermostat replacement/calibration** — Temperature inconsistency

### 4. Repair vs. Replacement Decision

Help customers understand when each makes sense. This builds trust.

**Present as a table or decision guide:**

| Factor | Lean Toward Repair | Lean Toward Replacement |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Age | Under 8 years | Over 10-12 years |
| Repair cost | Under 50% of new | Over 50% of new |
| Leak location | Fittings, valves | Tank body, main structure |
| History | First major issue | Multiple recent repairs |

**Include honest guidance language:**
- "We'll repair when it's a safe, smart fix."
- "We'll recommend replacement when repair won't hold up, won't be cost-effective, or creates safety risk."

### 5. Types and Options

Educational content about different systems, technologies, or approaches.

**Water Heater Types:**
- Tank vs. tankless comparison
- Gas vs. electric considerations
- Heat pump water heaters
- Solar options
- Sizing guidance

**Sewer Line Technologies:**
- Traditional excavation

- **Labor warranty** — Your workmanship guarantee
- **Parts warranty** — Coverage on components
- **Extended options** — When they make sense

### 7. Safety and Testing

Demonstrate professionalism by explaining safety practices:

**Water Heater:**
- Gas leak testing
- CO testing for gas units
- T&P valve verification
- Seismic strap inspection

**Sewer Line:**
- Camera inspection verification
- Pressure testing after repairs
- Proper cleanup and sanitization

### 8. Pricing Factors

Help customers understand what affects cost without giving specific prices:

- Parts and materials
- Code upgrades needed
- Permit requirements

**Time Estimates:**
- Give ranges for common services
- Explain what pushes toward higher end
- Emphasize upfront pricing

### 9. Maintenance Services

Preventive maintenance builds trust and recurring relationships:

- Anode rod inspection
- T&P valve testing
- Combustion check (gas units)

**Sewer Line Maintenance:**
- Preventive cleaning schedule
- Camera inspection baseline
- Root treatment programs

---

## Cross-Linking Requirements

### Required Links on Every General Service Page

1. **To city-specific service pages:**
   - "Where We Serve" section with links to city versions
   - Available for visitors who want local detail, but not the primary conversion path

2. **To related articles:**
   - Comparison guides
   - Educational content
   - Red flags / buyer's guides

3. **To related services:**
   - Complementary services (water heater → water filtration)
   - Emergency services when relevant

4. **To region pages:**
   - County-level pages for geographic context

### Link Placement Strategy

- **Early in page:** Phone number CTA, emergency links
- **Mid-page:** Related articles and educational content
- **End of page:** City-specific pages (for those who want local detail), final CTA

---

## Keywords and SEO

### Frontmatter Keywords Are Immutable

**Do not modify the keywords list in frontmatter** unless explicitly working on keyword strategy.

Keywords are strategically chosen to:
- Target gaps in competition (not just high volume)
- Minimize overlap between keyword phrases
- Maximize semantic diversity

**Why overlap is bad:** If "water heater repair" appears in 4 of 7 keywords, it looks like keyword stuffing to Google. The original keywords like "hot water tank repair," "tankless hot water repair," "water heaters repair" have minimal overlap—each targets a different search pattern.

### Primary Keywords

General service pages target broader, higher-volume keywords:
- "water heater repair"
- "sewer line replacement"
- "tankless water heater installation"

### Long-Tail Variations

Include problem-based and question-based phrases:
- "water heater not heating"
- "should I repair or replace my water heater"
- "trenchless sewer repair"
- "how long does water heater installation take"

### Keyword Placement

- Use primary keyword in first 100 words
- Include in H1 and at least one H2
- Work into image alt text
- Vary phrasing naturally throughout

3. **Missing immediate steps** — Urgent visitors need help now
4. **No repair vs. replace guidance** — Builds trust, shows honesty
5. **Buried phone number** — Make it prominent even on educational pages
6. **No stories or personality** — General pages can feel dry; add humanity
7. **Identical content to city pages** — General pages should be broader, more educational
8. **No methodology section** — Show how you work, not just what you do

## Relationship to City-Specific Pages

### What Goes on General Pages (Not City Pages)

- Comprehensive system type comparisons
- Detailed methodology explanations
- Broader FAQ coverage
- Technology deep-dives (trenchless, etc.)
- General repair vs. replace guidance

### What Goes on City Pages (Not General Pages)

- Local challenges and conditions
- Neighborhood-specific issues
- City permit and code details
- Local rebate programs
- City-specific FAQs

### Avoiding Duplication

- General pages: "Here's how water heaters work and what can go wrong"
- City pages: "Here's what goes wrong with water heaters *in Petaluma* specifically"

Both pages can mention the same repairs, but:
- General page: Explains what the repair is
- City page: Explains why that repair is common *here*

---

## Measuring Success

Track for general service pages:

- **Rankings:** Broad service keywords ("water heater repair," "sewer line replacement")

**General service pages succeed when they:**
1. Rank for broad service terms
2. Convert visitors who land on them
