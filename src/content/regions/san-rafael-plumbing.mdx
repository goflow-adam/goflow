    <h2>San Rafael Plumbing Peculiarities</h2>
    <p>
     Plumbing in San Rafael, CA comes with a few regional quirks that only experienced local plumbers truly understand. Homes in areas like Gerstle Park, Sun Valley, and Dominican often have aging copper, galvanized, or cast iron systems. These are materials that are prone to corrosion, leaks, and pressure issues over time. San Rafael has a mix of older neighborhoods, hillside properties, and bay-adjacent areas. This mix means everything from soil movement to salt air exposure can affect underground pipes and water systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your home deserves more than just a licensed plumber. You want someone who knows the infrastructure of San Rafael plumbing inside and out. Our team has decades of hands-on experience with the diverse systems found throughout the city.
