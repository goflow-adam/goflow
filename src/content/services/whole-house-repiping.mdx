  <h1>Professional Whole House Repiping Services</h1>
  <p>
    Let me tell you a little whole house repiping story.
    It's not about your typical house or typical repiping.
    This was a slaughterhouse.
    I was an apprentice in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
    Two journeymen, who had seen the jobsite, and I were given the task of repiping a slaughterhouse.
    When we got out of the van, they handed me a pair of muck boots.
    It made sense given what we were wading in to.
    Inside, they showed me what we were cutting out, and then they lifted this hatch in the floor.
    "Great, a basement," I thought. I was almost past the floor on the ladder going down into total darkness when they handed me a flashlight.
    I noticed they did not have boots and nor were they joining me. I turned on the flashlight but couldn't see much.
    Close to where I thought the floor should be I metâ€¦ resistance. A slow, thick squish. Like molasses. And then it hit me.
    I was standing in decades of coagulated blood of thousands of animals that had been processed above and leaked through the floor.
    I spent the day down there, cutting out the old pipes.
