    Your water heater looks like a big metal cylinder. Simple enough.
    But crack it open (don't actually do this) and you'll find a layered system
    engineered to hold pressure, retain heat, and resist corrosion for years.
    Understanding what's inside helps explain why these things last as long as they do—and
    why certain problems are more serious than others.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Outer Shell

    The metal casing you see from the outside. It provides structure and protects everything inside
    from bumps, moisture, and temperature swings in your garage or utility closet.

    Dents are usually cosmetic. Rust or corrosion on the outer shell is more interesting—it often means
    moisture is getting where it shouldn't, which could indicate a slow leak somewhere.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Insulation Layer

    Beneath the shell is a thick layer of foam insulation. Its job is to keep heat inside the tank
    so your burner doesn't have to work overtime.

    Good insulation means:
    * Lower energy bills
    * More consistent water temperature
    * Less wear on the system

    Older water heaters have thinner insulation. If yours is more than 10-15 years old,
    it's probably working harder than a newer model would.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Inner Tank

    This is where the action happens. The tank itself is steel, lined with a glass or enamel coating
    to prevent rust from constant contact with hot water.

    That lining does a good job, but it's not perfect. Over time, minerals settle at the bottom,
    tiny cracks develop in the coating, and corrosion finds a way in.
    This is why tanks eventually fail—and why the [anode rod](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater/)
    exists to buy you more time.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Drain Valve

    At the bottom of your tank is a small valve that lets you drain water and sediment out.
    Most people never touch it. That's a missed opportunity.

    Sediment builds up over time, especially if you have hard water. That layer of gunk:
    * Makes your heater work harder
    * Creates those popping or rumbling sounds you might hear
    * Accelerates tank failure

    Flushing the tank periodically clears this out. It's one of the simplest maintenance tasks
    you can do—or have us do—to extend your water heater's life.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Warning Signs

    Keep an eye out for:
    * Water pooling near the base
    * Rust-colored hot water
    * A drain valve that's stuck or leaking
    * Rumbling or knocking during heating cycles

    **A word of caution:** if your drain valve is stuck, don't force it.
    Older valves can snap off, and then you've got a real problem.

    ## The Bottom Line

    Your tank is built to work quietly for years. But when the internal layers start to fail,
    things can go sideways fast. Knowing what's inside—and what to watch for—gives you
    a head start on catching problems early.
