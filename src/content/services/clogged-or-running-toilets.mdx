    ## We Don't Tolerate Mischevious Toilets

    Your toilet is clogged, running, leaking, or your flapper is doing the Charlston
    like the tank is a speakeasy on a Saturday night.
    We won't be having any of that when you call us. Your toilet is our problem now.

    A clogged toilet can turn into an overflow. A running toilet quietly wastes
    a shocking amount of water. A leak at the base can damage flooring before you notice.

    Let's put an end to all of that with a call to us. Whether it's a simple clog or a toilet that needs replacing,
    we'll give you the straight dope about what's going on.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** and we'll get your toilet working rather than dancing again.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## What to Do Right Now

    Before we arrive, here's how to prevent a bigger mess:

    - **Water rising in the bowl?** Shut off the stop valve behind the toilet immediately.
    - **Only one toilet and it's clogged?** Don't keep flushing—call before it overflows.
    - **Toilet keeps running?** Shut off the stop valve to stop wasting water until we arrive.
    - **Leak at the base?** Stop using the toilet—water is getting under your flooring.

    ## Toilet Problems We Fix
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Clogged Toilet Service

    The most common call we get. We clear clogs without beating up your toilet or your bathroom.

    **What causes toilet clogs:**
    - Too much toilet paper at once
    - "Flushable" wipes (they're not really flushable)
    - Foreign objects (kids are creative)
    - Partial blockage in the drain line
    - Main sewer line backup (multiple fixtures affected)

    If it's a basic blockage, we'll handle it quickly.
    If it keeps happening, we'll find the real cause—sometimes it's not the toilet at all.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** for clogged toilet repair.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Running Toilet Repair

    A running toilet can waste 200+ gallons per day. That's money literally going down the drain.

    **Common causes:**
    - **Flapper worn or warped** — The #1 cause. Cheap part, easy fix.
    - **Fill valve failing** — Won't shut off properly, keeps running.
    - **Float adjusted wrong** — Water level too high, overflows into tube.
    - **Flush valve seat corroded** — Flapper can't seal properly.

    We diagnose the actual cause and fix it so you're not paying for wasted water.
    Most running toilet repairs take under an hour.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Leaking Toilet Repair

    Toilet leaks can happen in several places—and some are more serious than others.

    **Where toilets leak:**
    - **Base of toilet** — Usually a failed wax ring. Water is getting under your flooring.
    - **Tank to bowl** — Gasket or bolts need replacing.
    - **Supply line** — Connection to the wall. Often a simple fix.
    - **Tank cracks** — Rare but serious. Usually means replacement.

    Base leaks are the most urgent—water under flooring causes rot and mold.
    We'll identify the source, protect your flooring, and make a lasting repair.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Toilet Replacement and Installation

    Sometimes repair doesn't make sense. We'll tell you honestly when that's the case.

    **When to replace:**
    - Cracked tank or bowl
    - Constant repairs (throwing good money after bad)
    - Old toilet using 3-5 gallons per flush (new ones use 1.28)
    - Wobbling that won't stop (flange damage)
    - You just want a better toilet

    We install all major brands and can help you choose based on your priorities—
    water efficiency, comfort height, elongated vs. round, budget.

    ## How We Handle Toilet Repairs
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Our Process

    1. **We ask what's happening** — Symptoms tell us where to look first.
    2. **We inspect** — Tank internals, base, supply line, drain line if needed.
    3. **We diagnose** — Finding the actual cause, not just treating symptoms.
    4. **We explain options** — Repair vs. replace, with honest pricing.
    5. **We fix it** — Quality parts, clean work, respect for your bathroom.
    6. **We test** — Multiple flushes, checking for leaks, making sure it's right.

    Most toilet repairs are done in under an hour. We leave your bathroom cleaner than we found it.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Parts We Commonly Replace

    We carry common toilet parts on our trucks:

    - **Flappers** — The rubber seal at the bottom of the tank
    - **Fill valves** — Controls water refill after flush
    - **Flush valves** — The mechanism that releases water
    - **Wax rings** — Seals the toilet to the floor flange
    - **Supply lines** — The hose from the wall to the tank
    - **Tank bolts and gaskets** — Seal between tank and bowl

    For most repairs, we have what we need on the truck. No waiting for parts.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## What Affects Pricing

    We give upfront pricing before any work begins. Here's what affects the quote:

    - **Type of problem** — Simple flapper vs. wax ring vs. full replacement
    - **Parts needed** — Standard parts vs. specialty or hard-to-find
    - **Toilet condition** — Some older toilets have corroded bolts or damaged flanges
    - **Access** — Tight spaces take longer
    - **Urgency** — Emergency calls have different rates

    **Typical timeframes:**
    - Clog clearing: 15-45 minutes
    - Running toilet repair: 30-60 minutes
    - Wax ring replacement: 1-2 hours
    - Toilet replacement: 1-2 hours
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Repair vs. Replace

    **Repair usually makes sense when:**
    - The toilet is in good condition overall
    - It's a single issue (flapper, fill valve, wax ring)
    - The toilet is less than 15-20 years old
    - You're happy with the toilet otherwise

    **Replacement usually makes sense when:**
    - Cracked porcelain (can't be repaired)
    - Multiple recurring problems
    - Very old toilet wasting water (pre-1994 toilets use 3.5-5 gpf)
    - Damaged flange requiring major work anyway
    - You want an upgrade (comfort height, better flush, water savings)

    We'll give you honest advice based on your situation, not what makes us more money.

    ## Frequently Asked Questions
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Why does my toilet keep clogging?

    If it's happening repeatedly, the problem might not be the toilet.
    Could be a partial blockage in the drain line, root intrusion in the sewer,
    or a toilet that's not flushing powerfully enough. We can diagnose the real cause.

    ### Why won't my toilet stop running?

    Usually the flapper—a $10 part that wears out over time.
    Sometimes it's the fill valve or an adjustment issue.
    Either way, it's usually a quick fix.

    ### Is it worth repairing an old toilet?

    Depends on the problem. A $50 flapper replacement on a 20-year-old toilet? Worth it.
    A $200 repair on a toilet that's cracked and wastes water? Probably not.
    We'll give you honest advice.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### How much water does a running toilet waste?

    A badly running toilet can waste 200+ gallons per day—that's 6,000 gallons a month.
    Even a slow leak wastes significant water. Fixing it pays for itself quickly.

    ### Can I replace a toilet myself?

    Technically yes, but it's heavier and more awkward than it looks.
    A bad wax ring seal means water damage. A cracked flange means a wobbly toilet.
    Most people find it's worth having a pro do it right.

    ### How long does a toilet last?

    The porcelain can last 50+ years. The internal parts (flapper, fill valve) last 5-10 years.
    If you're replacing parts constantly, it might be time for a new toilet.
