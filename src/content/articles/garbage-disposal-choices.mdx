    ## How to Choose the Right Garbage Disposal
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. Motor Power and Size
    Garbage disposals range in power from 1/3 horsepower to 1 horsepower. Smaller motors are ideal for light use in apartments or households with minimal food waste, while larger motors are better suited for families that frequently cook.

    ### 2. Noise Level
    Some garbage disposals are designed with noise-reduction features that make kitchen cleanup quieter. If a peaceful kitchen environment is important to you, consider investing in a model with added insulation.

    ### 3. Grinding Chamber Material
    Stainless steel grinding components are durable and resist corrosion, ensuring a longer lifespan for your disposal. Investing in higher-quality materials can reduce the need for frequent repairs.

    ### 4. Batch vs. Continuous Feed
    Continuous feed models allow you to add food waste while the disposal runs, making them convenient for busy kitchens. Batch feed models operate only when a cover is securely in place, offering extra safety for homes with children.
