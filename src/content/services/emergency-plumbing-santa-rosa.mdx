faqs:
  - question: What qualifies as a plumbing emergency in Santa Rosa?
    answer: >-
      Anything that can cause damage if you wait: burst pipes, sewer backups,
      active leaks you can't stop, no water at all, gas smell near plumbing.
      If you're unsure, call us—we'll help you figure out if it needs immediate
      attention or can wait until morning.
  - question: How fast can an emergency plumber get to Santa Rosa?
    answer: >-
      We're based in Sonoma County, not dispatching from hours away. Depending
      on time of day and location, we can typically arrive within 60-90 minutes.
      We'll give you a clear arrival window when you call.
  - question: Is there an extra charge for after-hours emergency plumbing?
    answer: >-
      Emergency rates may differ from standard service, but we're upfront about
      pricing before we start any work. No surprise fees. You'll know the cost
      before we begin.
  - question: What should I do while waiting for the emergency plumber?
    answer: >-
      Shut off the main water valve if there's an active leak. Turn off electricity
      near affected areas. Stop using plumbing fixtures. Clear a path to the
      problem area. We'll guide you through specific steps when you call.
  - question: Do you handle gas leaks in Santa Rosa?
    answer: >-
      If you smell gas, evacuate immediately and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).
      Once they've cleared the area, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line
      issues. Safety first—always.
  - question: Can I wait until morning for a plumbing problem?
    answer: >-
      It depends. A dripping faucet? Sure. A burst pipe flooding your home?
      Absolutely not. Sewer backing up into your house? Call now. When in doubt,
      call us and we'll help you decide—no charge for the conversation.

    ## It's 2 AM. Something's Leaking. We Answer.

    The pipe behind the wall just let go. The sewer is backing up into the bathtub.
    The water heater picked Sunday morning to start flooding the garage.
    You're standing there wondering who to call at this hour.

    **We're that call.**

    **[Call (707) 200-8350 right now](tel:7072008350)** — we answer 24/7 for emergency plumbing in Santa Rosa.
    We'll give you a clear arrival window and get there as fast as traffic allows.

    ## What to Do Right Now

    While you wait for us, these steps can limit the damage:

    1. **Shut off the water** — Find your main shutoff valve (usually near the street or where the water line enters your home). Turn it clockwise until it stops. In older Santa Rosa neighborhoods like Roseland, shutoffs are often at the sidewalk; in Fountaingrove rebuilds, they're typically at the house.
    2. **Turn off electricity** — If water is near outlets, switches, or your electrical panel, shut off power to affected areas at the breaker.
    3. **Stop using plumbing** — Don't flush toilets, run water, or use appliances until we assess the situation.
    4. **Contain what you can** — Towels, buckets, moving valuables out of harm's way. Santa Rosa's older homes often have hardwood floors that can warp quickly.
    5. **Call us at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — We'll guide you through anything else specific to your situation.

    **Don't know where your shutoff is?** Call us anyway. We've talked hundreds of Santa Rosa homeowners through finding theirs while we're on our way.

    ## Emergency Plumbing Situations We Handle in Santa Rosa
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Burst or Broken Pipes
    That sound of rushing water behind the wall. The sudden drop in pressure.
    The puddle that's growing faster than you can mop.
    We locate the break, stop the water, and repair or replace the damaged section.
    Santa Rosa's mix of old galvanized, copper, and new PEX means we see every type of pipe failure.

    ### Sewer Backups
    When sewage comes up through floor drains, toilets, or tubs, you need someone there fast.
    We clear the blockage, assess the line condition, and make sure it's actually fixed—not just temporarily pushed through.
    Bennett Valley's clay soil and mature oaks make root intrusion a common culprit.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Water Heater Emergencies
    The tank that's leaking all over the garage floor. The pilot that won't stay lit when you need hot water most.
    The unit that's making sounds like it's about to give up.
    We repair what can be repaired and replace what needs replacing—even at odd hours.

    ### No Water at All
    You turn on the faucet and nothing comes out. Could be a main line break, a failed pressure regulator,
    or something at the meter. We diagnose and restore your water supply.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Overflowing Toilets
    When the plunger isn't cutting it and water is going places it shouldn't.
    We clear the clog and check for deeper issues in the drain line.
    If it's happening on multiple fixtures, that's a main line problem—and we handle those too.

    ### Active Leaks You Can't Stop
    Under the sink, behind the wall, from the ceiling—wherever it's coming from,
    we find it and stop it. Leak detection equipment helps us locate hidden leaks
    without tearing apart your home unnecessarily.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Gas Line Issues
    **If you smell gas, evacuate and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).**
    Once the area is safe, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line problems.
    We're licensed for gas work and take these calls seriously.

    ### Flooding and Water Damage
    Whether it's a failed sump pump, a backed-up drain, or a supply line that let go,
    we stop the source and help you understand next steps for cleanup and restoration.

    ## Why Fast Response Matters in Santa Rosa

    Plumbing emergencies get worse by the minute. Here's what can happen while you wait:

    - **Structural damage** — Water soaks into subfloors, drywall, and framing. The Fountaingrove and Coffey Park rebuilds have beautiful new finishes that water can ruin fast.
    - **Mold growth** — Can start within 24-48 hours. Santa Rosa's mild, damp winters create ideal conditions for mold once water gets into walls.
    - **Electrical hazards** — Water and electricity don't mix
    - **Contamination** — Sewer backups create health risks, especially in homes with crawl spaces common in Bennett Valley and the hills
    - **Escalating costs** — A small leak becomes a big repair

    We dispatch immediately because we know every hour matters. We're already in Santa Rosa most days—our response time here is often faster than anywhere else.
    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — let's stop the damage now.

    ## Our Emergency Process: What to Expect

    When you call us for emergency plumbing in Santa Rosa, here's exactly what happens:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. You Call, We Answer
    A real person picks up—not a call center in another state.
    We ask what's happening, where you are, and give you immediate guidance
    to limit damage while we're on our way. If you're in Fountaingrove, we might ask about your rebuild year. In Railroad Square, we're already thinking about cast iron.

    ### 2. We Dispatch Immediately
    Our trucks stay stocked for emergencies. We know every route through Santa Rosa—the back way through Rincon Valley, the shortcuts around downtown, which streets flood when it rains.
    You get a clear arrival window, and we keep you updated if anything changes.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. We Assess and Explain
    On arrival, we diagnose the problem and explain what we're seeing.
    You'll understand what's wrong, what it takes to fix it, and what it costs
    before we start any work. No pressure, no surprises. We'll also tell you if we spot something that's not urgent but worth watching.

    ### 4. We Fix It Right
    We don't do band-aid repairs that fail next week.
    We fix the problem properly so you're not calling us again for the same issue.
    We've fixed emergencies in the same Santa Rosa homes multiple generations of families have lived in. When we leave, you can go back to your life.

    ## Santa Rosa Emergency Plumbing Challenges

    As Sonoma County's largest city, Santa Rosa has unique emergency plumbing situations:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Fire Rebuild Areas
    Fountaingrove, Coffey Park, Mark West Springs—the 2017 fires changed the plumbing landscape.
    Brand-new systems connecting to decades-old city infrastructure.
    We understand where these connections fail and why emergencies happen at the transition points.

    ### Historic Neighborhoods
    Railroad Square, McDonald Avenue, Cherry Street—some of the oldest plumbing in Sonoma County.
    Century-old cast iron and galvanized steel that can fail suddenly after decades of service.
    We know how to work on these systems without creating new problems.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bennett Valley & the Hills
    Clay-heavy soil that stresses pipes. Mature oaks with aggressive root systems.
    Hillside homes where gravity and drainage work differently.
    Emergency sewer backups here often involve root intrusion we can clear and address.

    ### Established Neighborhoods
    Roseland, Montgomery Village, Southwest Santa Rosa—mid-century homes with aging infrastructure.
    Galvanized supply lines that can burst. Cast iron drains that crack.
    We've been working these areas for three generations and know what to expect.
