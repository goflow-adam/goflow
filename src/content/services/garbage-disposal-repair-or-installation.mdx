    ### Only Disposal Solutions We Would Offer Our Own Mom

    Your garbage disposal is jammed, humming, leaking, or just dead—and now your kitchen sink
    is out of commission. A broken disposal can stop your whole kitchen workflow and create
    odors fast.

    We'll diagnose the problem, tell you honestly whether repair makes sense or replacement
    is the smarter call, and get your sink working again.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** and we'll get your disposal sorted out.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## What to Do Right Now

    Before we arrive, here's how to avoid making things worse:

    - **Jammed?** Don't keep flipping the switch—that can burn out the motor.
    - **Leaking?** Stop using the disposal and dry out the cabinet to prevent water damage.
    - **Going to check it yourself?** Turn off power first (switch AND breaker to be safe).
    - **Smell coming from it?** Run cold water and see if it drains. If not, don't use it.

    If you're considering a new unit, this guide can help you choose:

    ## Garbage Disposal Problems We Fix
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Disposal Won't Turn On

    You flip the switch and... nothing. Or maybe just a hum.

    **Common causes:**
    - **Needs reset** — The red button on the bottom popped. Easy fix.
    - **Jammed** — Something's stuck and the motor won't spin.
    - **Tripped breaker** — Check your electrical panel.
    - **Bad switch** — The wall switch failed, not the disposal.
    - **Motor burned out** — Usually means replacement time.

    We'll diagnose which one it is. Sometimes it's a $0 fix (reset button).
    Sometimes the unit is done.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Disposal is Leaking

    Leaks can come from several places, and the location tells us whether it's repairable:

    - **Top flange** — Where disposal meets sink. Often fixable with new putty or tightening.
    - **Side connections** — Dishwasher inlet or drain pipe. Usually a gasket or connection issue.
    - **Bottom of unit** — Internal seal failure. Usually means replacement.
    - **Reset button area** — Internal failure. Replacement needed.

    Bottom leaks almost always mean the unit is done. Top and side leaks are often repairable.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Strange Noises

    Disposals make noise—that's normal. But some sounds mean trouble:

    - **Grinding/clanking** — Something hard is in there (silverware, bone, glass).
    - **Humming but not spinning** — Jammed. Motor is trying but can't turn.
    - **Rattling** — Loose mounting or internal component.
    - **Metal-on-metal screeching** — Internal damage. Not good.
    - **Louder than usual** — Bearings wearing out. Replacement coming.

    Foreign objects are an easy fix. Internal damage usually means replacement.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Disposal Clogs and Slow Draining

    The disposal runs but water backs up or drains slowly.

    **Common causes:**
    - **Buildup in disposal** — Grease and food residue narrowing the chamber.
    - **Clogged drain line** — The problem is downstream, not the disposal itself.
    - **Improper use** — Too much at once, wrong foods, not enough water.

    We'll clear the clog, check the drain path, and tell you if it's a disposal issue
    or a drain line issue.
  </div>

    ## Repair vs. Replace
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### When Repair Makes Sense

    - **Reset button fix** — Free if you do it, minimal cost if we do.
    - **Jam removal** — Usually quick and inexpensive.
    - **Top flange leak** — Resealing is cheaper than replacement.
    - **Side connection leak** — Gasket or fitting replacement.
    - **Clog clearing** — Unless the disposal caused the clog by failing.

    If the disposal is less than 5 years old and the motor still works,
    repair usually makes sense.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### When Replacement Makes Sense

    - **Bottom leak** — Internal seal failure. Can't be repaired cost-effectively.
    - **Motor burned out** — The disposal is done.
    - **Frequent problems** — If you're calling us every few months, replace it.
    - **Old unit** — Disposals last 8-15 years. If yours is old and acting up, replace.
    - **You want an upgrade** — Quieter, more powerful, better features.

    We'll tell you honestly which situation you're in. We don't push replacements
    when repair makes sense.

    ### Choosing a New Disposal

    If you need a new unit, here's what to consider:

    **Horsepower:**
    - **1/3 HP** — Light use, small households, soft foods only.
    - **1/2 HP** — Standard for most homes. Handles typical kitchen waste.
    - **3/4 HP** — Better for families, handles tougher scraps.
    - **1 HP+** — Heavy use, fibrous foods, large households.

    **Features to consider:**
    - **Noise level** — Higher-end units are significantly quieter.
    - **Stainless steel components** — Last longer, resist corrosion.
    - **Auto-reverse** — Helps prevent jams.
    - **Batch feed vs. continuous feed** — Safety vs. convenience.

    We install all major brands including InSinkErator, Waste King, Moen, and others.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### What Installation Includes

    - **Removal of old unit** — Proper disposal (pun intended).
    - **Mounting new disposal** — Secure connection to sink.
    - **Electrical connection** — Hardwired or plug-in depending on setup.
    - **Drain connections** — Including dishwasher inlet if applicable.
    - **Testing** — Making sure everything works and doesn't leak.
    - **Cleanup** — We don't leave a mess.

    Most installations take 1-2 hours. If you're adding a disposal where there wasn't one,
    it may take longer (electrical work, drain modifications).
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## What Affects Pricing

    We give upfront pricing before any work begins. Here's what affects the quote:

    - **Repair vs. replace** — Repairs are generally less expensive.
    - **Type of repair** — Jam removal vs. flange reseal vs. drain clearing.
    - **Disposal unit** — If replacing, the unit cost varies by brand and power.
    - **Installation complexity** — Standard replacement vs. new installation.
    - **Electrical work** — If wiring modifications are needed.

    **Typical timeframes:**
    - Jam removal: 15-30 minutes
    - Leak repair: 30-60 minutes
    - Standard replacement: 1-2 hours
    - New installation: 2-3 hours
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Keeping Your Disposal Happy

    **Do:**
    - Run cold water before, during, and after use.
    - Feed waste gradually, not all at once.
    - Run it regularly to prevent rust and buildup.
    - Clean it occasionally with ice cubes and citrus peels.

    **Don't:**
    - Put grease or oil down the disposal.
    - Grind fibrous foods (celery, artichokes, corn husks).
    - Put expandable foods (pasta, rice) in large quantities.
    - Grind bones, fruit pits, or shells.
    - Use hot water while grinding (melts grease, then it solidifies downstream).

    Proper use extends disposal life significantly.

    ## Frequently Asked Questions
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Is it worth repairing an old garbage disposal?

    Depends on the problem. A jam or reset issue? Yes, fix it.
    A bottom leak or burned-out motor on a 10-year-old unit? Probably replace.
    We'll give you honest advice based on the specific situation.

    ### How long do garbage disposals last?

    Typically 8-15 years depending on use and quality.
    Heavy use, improper items, and lack of water shorten lifespan.
    If yours is over 10 and having problems, replacement often makes more sense.

    ### Can I install a garbage disposal myself?

    Technically yes, but it involves plumbing and electrical work.
    Improper installation causes leaks and can be a safety hazard.
    Most people find it's worth having a pro do it right.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Why does my disposal smell bad?

    Food residue builds up inside. Run cold water longer after grinding,
    and occasionally clean with ice and citrus. If the smell persists,
    there may be buildup in the drain line downstream.

    ### Why does my disposal hum but not spin?

    It's jammed. Something is preventing the blades from turning.
    Don't keep trying—you'll burn out the motor. Turn off power,
    use an Allen wrench in the bottom to manually turn it, or call us.

    ### Do you install InSinkErator disposals?

    Yes, we install all major brands including InSinkErator, Waste King,
    Moen, and others. We can recommend a unit based on your needs and budget,
    or install one you've already purchased.
