    <div itemProp="step" itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/HowToStep">
      <h3 itemProp="name">1. Motor Power and Size</h3>
      <div itemProp="text">
        <p>Garbage disposals range in power from 1/3 horsepower to 1 horsepower. Smaller motors are ideal for light use in apartments or households with minimal food waste, while larger motors are better suited for families that frequently cook and require more robust grinding capabilities.</p>

    <div itemProp="step" itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/HowToStep">
      <h3 itemProp="name">2. Noise Level</h3>
      <div itemProp="text">
        <p>Some garbage disposals are designed with noise-reduction features that make kitchen cleanup quieter. If a peaceful kitchen environment is important to you, consider investing in a model with added insulation for reduced noise.</p>

      <h3 itemProp="name">3. Grinding Chamber Material</h3>
      <div itemProp="text">
        <p>Stainless steel grinding components are durable and resist corrosion, ensuring a longer lifespan for your disposal. Investing in higher-quality materials can reduce the need for frequent repairs.</p>

      <h3 itemProp="name">4. Batch vs. Continuous Feed</h3>
      <div itemProp="text">
        <p>Continuous feed models allow you to add food waste while the disposal runs, making them convenient for busy kitchens. Batch feed models operate only when a cover is securely in place, offering extra safety for homes with children.</p>
