faqs:
  - question: "Do you provide emergency plumbing in Petaluma?"
    answer: "Yes. If you have an active leak, no hot water, a sewer smell, or a drain backup that can’t wait, call us. We’ll give you a clear arrival window and help you get the situation under control quickly."
  - question: "Can you help with recurring drain clogs in older Petaluma neighborhoods?"
    answer: "Yes. Older drain configurations and certain pipe materials can clog or restrict more easily. We can clear the line safely and recommend next steps (like a camera inspection) so you’re not stuck repeating the same clog." 
  - question: "Do you install and repair water heaters in Petaluma?"
    answer: "Yes. We repair and install water heaters in Petaluma, including replacement when repair doesn’t make sense. We’ll explain your options and size the system correctly for your home."
  - question: "What are red flags when hiring a plumber?"
    answer: "High-pressure upsells, vague pricing, and no clear explanation of what’s being repaired are common warning signs. If you want a quick checklist, see our guide on plumber red flags."

    ## What to do while you wait (a quick homeowner checklist)
    If there’s active leaking, shut off the nearest valve (or the home’s main),
    move anything valuable away from the area,
    and avoid using fixtures that might worsen the problem.
    If there’s a sewer backup, stop running water and call right away.

    ## Other Petaluma Plumbing Companies
    When you’re stressed and water is going somewhere it shouldn’t,
    it’s easy for <a href="/articles/plumber-red-flags/">the wrong plumber</a>
    to take advantage of the moment.
    We’ve seen homeowners pushed into repairs they didn’t need, quoted one thing and billed another,
    or left with a “fix” that fails a few weeks later.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ask for a clear scope</strong>: What exactly is being repaired or replaced, and why?</li>
      <li><strong>Beware of urgency pressure</strong>: “Sign right now or it gets worse” is a common tactic.</li>
      <li><strong>Look for diagnosis, not guessing</strong>: Recurring clogs, leaks, and pressure issues deserve a real explanation.</li>
      <li><strong>Expect clean work and protection</strong>: Your floors, cabinets, and walls should be treated like they matter—because they do.</li>
      <li><strong>Code-aware decisions</strong>: Work done wrong can become a costly problem during a home inspection later.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Petaluma’s Unique Plumbing Challenges
    Petaluma’s older neighborhoods—like Oakhill-Brewster, West Petaluma,
    and the historic downtown—often come with older plumbing materials and older drain configurations.
    That can show up as slow drains, corrosion leaks, or pressure issues.
    
    Petaluma’s winter rains and changing soil conditions can also stress older
    underground lines over time—especially in low-lying or clay-heavy areas.
    
    That’s why the goal isn’t just a quick fix—it’s a fix that lasts.
    We want you to feel confident calling the problem “done.”
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Water quality, pressure, and efficiency upgrades
    In Petaluma, water quality and pressure can vary by neighborhood.
    If you’re seeing mineral buildup, premature fixture failures, inconsistent pressure,
    or you want to reduce water waste,
    we’ll walk you through options like filtration, pressure regulation, and efficient fixture upgrades.
