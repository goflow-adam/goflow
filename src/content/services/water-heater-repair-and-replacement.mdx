  ### No hot water is more than an inconvenience.
  Your water heater is acting up. It's leaking, not heating, or acting unpredictably.
  It is messing with your home life and **we want to be the ones to put it right**.
  You need a water heater expert who can diagnose the cause and deliver the right-sized fix
  getting your hot water back.

  We only offer the water heater solutions we would offer our own moms.

  [Call now](tel:7072008350) and we’ll help you figure out what’s going on
  and what it will take to get hot water back.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ## What to Do Right Now (Quick Homeowner Checklist)
  - If you see active leaking, shut off the cold supply to the heater.
  - If the tank is leaking from the body of the heater, stop using it—tank leaks typically get worse.
  - If you smell gas or suspect a dangerous condition, leave the area and call your gas utility.
  - If water is pooling near electrical components, avoid the area and call.

  [Call us](tel:7072008350) as soon as you are ready or see more here: [24/7 emergency plumbing](/emergency-plumbing-services/).

  ## What We Repair (Tank, Tankless, Gas, and Electric)
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Traditional Tank Water Heater Repair and Installs
  Common issues we address:
  - No hot water / inconsistent temperature
  - Pilot or ignition failures
  - Pressure relief valve concerns
  - Thermostat and heating element failures
  - Leaks at fittings, valves, and connections
  - Sediment buildup reducing performance
</div>
<div class="two-column">
### Tankless Water Heaters Repair and Installs
Common issues we address:
- Error codes and intermittent shutdowns
- Flow/temperature inconsistency
- Mineral scaling and descaling needs
- Ignition and venting-related problems
- Component replacement when needed
</div>
<div class="two-column">
## How We Run a Water Heater Repair Call
We keep it simple:
- Ask a few questions so we arrive prepared
- Inspect, test, and pinpoint the failure (not guessing)
- Explain what we found in plain language
- Give you a clear price and the options
- Do the repair cleanly and test before we leave
</div>
<div class="two-column">
## Repair vs Replace (When Each One Makes Sense)
We’ll repair when it’s a safe, smart fix.
We’ll recommend replacement when the repair won’t hold up, won’t be cost-effective, or creates safety risk.

Replacement is more likely when:
- The tank is leaking from the body
- The unit is older and repeatedly failing
- Corrosion or damage makes repair unreliable
- Efficiency is so poor you’re paying for it every month
