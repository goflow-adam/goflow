faqs:
  - question: "What are the main advantages of tankless water heaters?"
    answer: "Tankless hot water heaters provide endless hot water on demand, save space with their compact design, offer precise temperature control, and typically last 20+ years with proper maintenance."
  - question: "What's the difference between gas and electric tankless water heaters?"
    answer: "Gas tankless water heaters deliver higher flow rates and work better for larger households with simultaneous hot water needs. Electric tankless water heaters offer quieter operation, simpler installation, and zero emissions. Both provide endless hot water on demand."
  - question: "Are tankless water heaters good for large families?"
    answer: "Yes — tankless systems can be sized to meet any family's needs. For high-demand households, we recommend gas tankless systems or multiple units strategically placed throughout the home to ensure consistent hot water delivery everywhere it's needed."
  - question: "How long do tankless hot water heaters last?"
    answer: "Most tankless hot water heaters last 20+ years with proper maintenance, which is almost twice the lifespan of traditional systems. Regular maintenance keeps them operating at peak efficiency."
  - question: "Do instant hot water heaters work in cold climates?"
    answer: "Yes. Performance depends on incoming water temperature, but modern tankless systems are designed to handle cold climates effectively. Gas tankless units typically provide better performance in very cold regions due to their higher heating capacity."
  - question: "Which hot water system is best for vacation homes?"
    answer: "Tankless systems are ideal for vacation properties because they only operate when you need hot water. This means no energy waste while the home is unoccupied, plus you'll never run out of hot water when the house is full of guests."
  - question: "What makes tankless water heaters more efficient?"
    answer: "Tankless systems heat water only when needed, eliminating the standby energy loss from storing hot water. They also feature advanced flow sensors and precise temperature controls to deliver exactly the amount of hot water required."
  - question: "What's involved in a tankless water heater installation?"
    answer: "Professional installation includes a site assessment to evaluate your home's specific needs, selection of the right system size, and proper setup of venting, water lines, and controls. At GoFlow Plumbing, we handle the entire process and provide complete system training."
