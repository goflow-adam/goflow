faqs:
  - question: "Is a slow drain an emergency?"
    answer: "Not always, but it's a warning sign. A slow drain can turn into a backup quickly (especially if multiple fixtures are affected). If you're seeing water rise, gurgling, or recurring clogs, call us and we'll help you decide what to do next."
  - question: "Should I use chemical drain cleaner?"
    answer: "We generally don't recommend it. Many chemical cleaners can damage pipes and make the problem harder (and messier) to fix. If you want to try something safe, we can talk you through simple first steps and then schedule service if needed."
  - question: "Do you use cameras or hydro-jetting?"
    answer: "Yes. When it's helpful, we use video camera inspection to see what's actually happening, and hydro-jetting to clear buildup and restore full flow—not just punch a hole through a clog."
  - question: "What do you do to keep the home clean during drain work?"
    answer: "We protect the work area, work clean, and fully clean up. If we use a camera or need to open a cleanout, we'll explain what we're doing before we do it."
  - question: "Do you offer same-day drain cleaning in Santa Rosa?"
    answer: "In many cases, yes—especially for active backups and no-drain situations. Call us and we'll give you a clear arrival window."

    It starts with drop cloths and shoe covers and finishes up when
    **we leave your home cleaner than when we arrived.**
    We walk you through every option for your plumbing problem—honest guidance from plumbers who genuinely want
    the best outcome for you, not the biggest invoice.

    ## Why Santa Rosa Trusts Us

    We don't just unclog drains—we fix them so they stay fixed. When we pack up and leave, 
    you shouldn't have to think about that drain again for years.

    **We've watched this city evolve.** Three generations of our family have worked here.
    Through the fires and the rebuilds. We've adapted as the infrastructure changed,
    and we understand things other plumbers miss—like why a Fountaingrove rebuild might have
    issues where new plumbing meets old city lines.

    **We know every neighborhood.** The cast iron in Railroad Square. The galvanized steel in Roseland.
    The clay soil in Bennett Valley. The brand-new systems in Coffey Park. Each requires a different approach.

    **Honest pricing, always.** The number we quote is the number you pay. No surprise line items.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's get your drains working.**

    ## What We Clear in Santa Rosa Homes

    From Railroad Square to Rincon Valley, we've unclogged every type of drain Santa Rosa can throw at us:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bathroom Issues
    - Stubborn toilets that need more than a plunger
    - Showers where water rises instead of drains
    - Bathtubs still holding water an hour later
    - Sinks that gurgle and drain slowly
    - The dreaded "everything's backing up" situation
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Kitchen Problems
    - Garbage disposals that hum but won't grind
    - Sinks full of standing water
    - Dishwasher water coming back up
    - Clogs that return no matter what you try
    - Years of grease finally catching up
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Laundry & Garage
    - Washer drains flooding the floor
    - Utility sink refusing to empty
    - Garage floor drains backing up
    - Drainage line problems
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Sewer Line Issues
    - When every drain in the house is affected
    - That unmistakable sewer smell
    - Bennett Valley's notorious root intrusion
    - Pipes that have cracked or collapsed
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Our Process: No Guessing, Just Results

    Santa Rosa's mix of old and new plumbing means we can't afford to guess. Here's how we actually work:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. Assess the Situation
    We run water, check fixtures, and listen to your system. One clog or a main line problem?
    Cameras go in when we need to see what's happening deep in the line.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 2. Explain Before We Act
    You'll know what's happening and what it costs before we start.
    Plain English. No pressure. You decide what makes sense.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. Get It Cleared
    Cable machines for routine clogs. Hydro jetting for serious buildup. 
    Root cutters for those Bennett Valley oaks. We keep at it until it's done.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 4. Verify and Advise
    We confirm everything's flowing, then share tips to keep it that way.
    If we spotted something concerning, we'll mention it—but we don't push repairs you don't need.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">

    ## Santa Rosa's Unique Drain Challenges

    As Sonoma County's largest city, Santa Rosa has the most varied plumbing infrastructure in the region.
    Here's what makes drain cleaning here different:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Fire-Affected Areas
    Fountaingrove, Coffey Park, Mark West Springs—the 2017 fires changed everything. 
    Brand-new plumbing connecting to decades-old city infrastructure. We understand 
    where these systems meet and why problems happen at the connection points.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Historic Neighborhoods
    Railroad Square, McDonald Avenue, Cherry Street—some of the oldest plumbing in Sonoma County.
    Century-old cast iron, original drain systems, heritage homes that need careful techniques.
    We don't destroy what makes these homes special.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bennett Valley & the Hills
    Clay-heavy soil that stresses pipes and encourages root intrusion. Those beautiful oaks?
    Their roots are finding every pipe joint. Hillside drainage that depends on proper slope.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Roseland & Established Areas
    Working-class neighborhoods with aging galvanized infrastructure. Mid-century homes 
    with 50-60 year old drain systems. Montgomery Village, Southwest Santa Rosa—
    we've been working these areas for three generations.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## How to Avoid Calling Us (We'll Survive)
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Smart Moves:
    - Strainers on every drain—they cost a few bucks and save hundreds
    - Hot water flush after running the disposal
    - Deal with slow drains before they become no-drains
    - Maintenance visits if clogs keep coming back
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Stuff That Causes Problems:
    - Grease in any drain (it coats pipes and catches everything)
    - "Flushable" wipes (marketing lies—they clog pipes)
    - Chemical drain cleaners (they dissolve your pipes too)
    - Hoping that gurgling sound fixes itself (spoiler: it won't)
