faqs:
  - question: "How do I know if it’s a main line clog?"
    answer: "If more than one fixture is backing up (for example, a shower and toilet at the same time), or you see water coming up in a lower drain when you use a sink, that often points to a main line issue. Stop using water and call us so we can prevent a bigger backup."
  - question: "Do you use a camera before you start clearing the drain?"
    answer: "When the problem is recurring, severe, or involves multiple fixtures, yes. A quick camera inspection can show us buildup, roots, a belly, or damage so we can choose the right approach and avoid unnecessary work."
  - question: "What’s the difference between snaking and hydro-jetting?"
    answer: "A professional cable/snake breaks through a clog. Hydro-jetting uses high-pressure water to clean the pipe walls and remove heavy buildup. We’ll recommend the option that fits your pipe type and the actual cause of the blockage."
  - question: "Can you help if my drain backs up during heavy rain?"
    answer: "Yes. In some San Rafael areas, drainage and runoff can contribute to backups—especially if lines are partially restricted. We can clear the blockage and also talk through preventive steps to reduce repeat issues."
  - question: "Will you keep the work area clean?"
    answer: "Yes. We protect floors and surfaces, communicate before we open cleanouts or run a camera, and clean up thoroughly when the job is done."

We start by understanding what you’re seeing, then we choose the right tool for the job.
