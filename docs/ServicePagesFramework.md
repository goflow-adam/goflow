# Service Pages Content Framework

> **The Core Question Every Service+City Page Must Answer:**
> *"How do you solve this specific problem in my specific city?"*

This framework applies to city-specific service pages like `drain-cleaning-novato.mdx` and `water-heater-repair-san-rafael.mdx`. For general region pages, see [RegionPagesFramework.md](./RegionPagesFramework.md).

---

## Core Principle: Speak to the Specific Problem

**Every service page should speak to that specific service, not plumbing in general.**

A water heater page should talk about water heaters—not "plumbing problems." A drain cleaning page should talk about drains—not "your home's systems."

**Why this matters:**
- Visitors arrived because they have a *specific* problem
- Generic plumbing language dilutes relevance and trust
- Search engines reward topical focus
- Specificity demonstrates expertise

**Examples:**

| Too Generic | Service-Specific |
|-------------|------------------|
| "We fix plumbing problems" | "We fix water heaters that won't heat, leak, or make strange noises" |
| "Our plumbers are experienced" | "We've replaced thousands of thermocouples and gas valves" |
| "Quality plumbing service" | "Drain cleaning that actually lasts—not just pushing the clog down the line" |
| "We handle all your plumbing needs" | "From sediment flushes to full tank replacements, we handle every water heater issue" |

**Apply this principle to:**
- Headlines and section titles
- Problem descriptions
- Process explanations
- Trust statements
- CTAs

---

## How Service Pages Differ from Region Pages

| Region Pages | Service Pages |
|--------------|---------------|
| Focus: "Why is plumbing different here?" | Focus: "How do you solve this specific problem?" |
| Content: Geography, housing, water district | Content: Service process, equipment, techniques |
| Visitor intent: Research, general plumbing needs | Visitor intent: Specific problem, ready to act |
| Unique sections: Neighborhoods, climate, history | Unique sections: Problem types, methodology, prevention |

**Service pages are more transactional.** The visitor has a specific problem (clogged drain, broken water heater) and wants to know:
1. Can you fix it?
2. How do you fix it?
3. Why should I trust you?
4. What will it cost?
5. How fast can you get here?

---

## Page Structure & Section Ordering

**Put actionable content first.** Visitors arrive with an active problem. Answer their immediate questions before providing background.

### Recommended Section Order

| Position | Content Type | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| 1 | **Empathy intro** — Acknowledge their stress, state your intent | Builds connection immediately |
| 2 | **Image** | Visual trust signal |
| 3 | **Immediate steps** — What to do right now | Helps them while they wait |
| 4 | **Our approach** — How we work in your home | Trust + process transparency |
| 5 | **Problem types we fix** — Specific to this service | Answers "can you help me?" |
| 6 | **Our process** — Diagnose, explain, fix, verify | Shows professionalism |
| 7 | **Local challenges** — City-specific issues | Demonstrates local expertise |
| 8 | **Emergency availability** | Critical for urgent problems |
| 9 | **Why trust us** — 3rd generation, honest pricing | Conversion content |
| 10 | **Prevention tips** | Helpful, builds trust |
| 11 | **FAQs** — Service + city specific | Answers remaining concerns |
| 12 | **Neighborhoods served** | Local SEO |
| 13 | **Nearby communities / cross-links** | Internal linking |
| 14 | **Final CTA** | Clear next step |

### Why This Order Works

- Someone with an active leak needs immediate steps, not neighborhood history
- Process transparency early builds trust before asking for the call
- Local challenges section proves you know this city
- FAQs address objections before the final CTA
- Prevention tips show you're not just trying to sell—you want to help

### What to Avoid

- Leading with "About Us" content before addressing their problem
- Burying the phone number below the fold
- Putting FAQs at the very bottom where few will see them
- Starting with local history before service information

## The GoFlow Personality on Service Pages

**The customer is having a bad day.** Their drain is backing up, their water heater just died, or something is making a noise that sounds like a dying whale. They're stressed. They're annoyed. They might be standing in water.

**Your job is to lighten the mood while solving the problem.**

We're not writing legal documents. We're talking to a neighbor who needs help. Be the plumber who makes them smile while fixing their pipes.

### Open with Empathy + a Light Touch

Acknowledge their situation, but don't be grim about it:

**Too formal:**
> "We understand you are experiencing a plumbing emergency and we are here to assist."

**Too casual:**
> "Yo, your drain's messed up? We got you."

**Just right:**
> "That recurring clog, the gurgling sounds, the backup threatening your floors—we're hat-in-hand and ready to roll."

> "Your water heater says, 'It's not you, it's me.' And for once, you know that's true. Let us save your relationship with hot water."

> "Your clogged drain just became our problem to solve. It smells funky and it isn't pretty to you, but it's exactly what we're looking for."

### Use Humor to Lighten the Mood

Plumbing problems are stressful. A little humor goes a long way:

**Examples that work:**
- "We won't be raiding your fridge even though we'll be treating your home like our own mom's."
- "Su casa es mi casa. Well, not really, but we'll treat it that way."
- "Sewage doesn't care that it's Thanksgiving morning. Neither do we."
- "That gurgling sound? That's your drain asking for help."
- "We've seen worse. Actually, we've seen much worse. This is nothing."

**The goal:** Make them exhale. Make them think "these guys seem human."

### Colloquialisms and Conversational Language

Write like you talk. Use contractions. Use sentence fragments when they work.

| Formal | Conversational |
|--------|----------------|
| "We will arrive promptly." | "We'll be there soon." |
| "Our technicians are highly trained." | "We know what we're doing." |
| "Please do not hesitate to contact us." | "Just call. Seriously, any hour." |
| "We provide comprehensive drain services." | "We fix drains. All of them." |
| "The issue has been resolved." | "Done. You're good." |

### State Your Intent (Simply)

> "That's exactly what we want too. We're plumbers who genuinely want to fix your problem. Our goal is simple: handle this the right way so you can get peace of mind."

No corporate speak. No mission statements. Just: we want to fix this for you.

### Invite Action with Partnership Language

> "Call us, tell us what's happening, and let us make your plumbing problem ours."

**"Make your problem ours"** is the core GoFlow promise. Use it.

### Voice Characteristics

- **Conversational** — write like you're talking to a neighbor
- **Playful** — humor is welcome, even expected
- **Colloquial** — contractions, fragments, casual phrasing
- **First person plural** ("we") — we're a team, not a faceless company
- **Direct address** ("you," "your home") — talking to this specific person
- **Honest** — willing to say "this might not need us" or "here's what you can try first"
- **Confident but not arrogant** — we're good at this, but we're not bragging
- **Self-deprecating when appropriate** — we're plumbers, not brain surgeons

### What GoFlow Voice is NOT

- **Corporate** — no "we strive to exceed expectations"
- **Stiff** — no "please do not hesitate"
- **Salesy** — no "Act now!" or "Limited time offer!"
- **Generic** — no "your trusted local plumber"
- **Overly technical** — explain things in plain English
- **Condescending** — never talk down to DIYers
- **Grim** — don't make their bad day feel worse

### The Read-Aloud Test

Read your content out loud. Does it sound like:
- A real person talking? ✅
- A brochure? ❌
- A legal disclaimer? ❌
- Something you'd actually say to a customer? ✅

If it sounds like marketing copy, rewrite it until it sounds like a conversation.

## Differentiation Strategies

### The Problem: Templated Similarity

Current service pages share too much identical content:
- Same "drop cloths and shoe covers" phrasing verbatim
- Same "Take These Steps" list structure
- Same "Habits That Help / Things to Avoid" format
- Same section order across all cities

### Strategy 1: Vary the Expression

**Don't copy-paste phrases across pages.** Say the same thing differently:

| Concept | Novato Version | San Rafael Version | Santa Rosa Version |
|---------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| We protect your home | "Drop cloths protect your floors. Shoe covers go on at the door." | "Your floors get drop cloths. Your entryway gets shoe covers." | "Drop cloths down. Shoe covers on. Your home protected from the moment we walk in." |
| We're local | "We've been here through it all—watching Hamilton transform from military base to family neighborhood." | "We grew up here. Three generations watching Marin County change." | "We've watched this city evolve. Through the fires and the rebuilds." |

### Strategy 2: Lead with Different Local Challenges

Each city has unique issues. Lead with the most distinctive:

| City | Drain Cleaning Lead | Water Heater Lead |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Novato | Hamilton Field military-era plumbing | Compact utility closets in Hamilton |
| San Rafael | Hillside drainage + tidal influence | Coastal air corrosion + pressure variations |
| Santa Rosa | Fire rebuilds + historic Victorians | Most diverse housing stock in Sonoma County |
| Petaluma | Historic district + heritage trees | Hard water destroying tanks faster |

### Strategy 3: Vary Section Order

While maintaining logical flow, emphasize different aspects:

- **Novato drain cleaning:** Lead with Hamilton Field section (unique military history)
- **San Rafael drain cleaning:** Lead with hillside/bay-adjacent challenges (terrain)
- **Santa Rosa drain cleaning:** Lead with fire-affected areas (recent history)
- **Petaluma drain cleaning:** Lead with historic district (preservation concerns)

### Strategy 4: Different Problem Emphasis

Each city sees different problem distributions. Emphasize accordingly:

| City | Drain Problems to Emphasize | Water Heater Problems to Emphasize |
|------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Novato | Military-era plumbing quirks, clay soil in Ignacio | Compact spaces, older gas lines |
| San Rafael | Root intrusion from mature oaks, tidal influence | Coastal corrosion, pressure variations |
| Santa Rosa | Fire rebuild connections to old infrastructure | Mix of brand-new and 40-year-old systems |
| Petaluma | Heritage tree roots, high water table downtown | Hard water scale, undersized gas lines |

### Strategy 5: Unique Anchors Per Page

Each page should have at least one detail that *only* applies to that city:

- **Novato:** Hamilton Field's military housing conversion
- **San Rafael:** MMWD as California's oldest water district
- **Santa Rosa:** 2017 Tubbs Fire rebuilds
- **Petaluma:** National Register Historic District preservation

## Expanded Content Topics

These topics add depth and demonstrate expertise. Include them where relevant to the specific service.

### Common Repairs (Service-Specific)

List the actual repair work you do—not generic "we fix problems" language. This builds credibility and helps customers identify their issue.

**Water Heater Common Repairs:**
- **Thermocouple replacement** — The #1 reason pilot lights won't stay lit. A $20 part that takes 30 minutes.
- **Gas valve replacement** — When the thermocouple isn't the problem, the gas valve often is. More involved but still a repair, not a replacement.
- **Heating element replacement** — Electric water heaters. Upper or lower element, sometimes both.
- **Thermostat replacement/calibration** — When temperature is inconsistent or won't reach the set point.
- **Anode rod replacement** — Preventive maintenance that extends tank life by 2-3 years. Should be checked annually.
- **Dip tube replacement** — When you get lukewarm water even with a full tank.
- **T&P valve replacement** — Safety valve that may leak or fail to operate.
- **Sediment flush** — Not technically a repair, but essential maintenance that restores efficiency.

**Drain Cleaning Common Repairs:**
- **P-trap clearing/replacement** — Often the source of bathroom sink clogs.
- **Cleanout access installation** — Adding access points for future maintenance.
- **Partial line replacement** — When a section is damaged but the whole line is sound.
- **Root cutting** — Mechanical removal of root intrusion.
- **Descaling** — Removing mineral buildup from inside pipes.

**How to present repairs:**
- Name the specific repair
- Briefly explain what it fixes
- Give context on complexity/time when helpful
- Avoid making everything sound like a major project

### Warranties

Customers want to know what's covered and for how long. Be specific about warranty types and what they actually mean.

**Types of Warranties to Address:**

1. **Manufacturer Warranty**
   - Covers defects in the equipment itself
   - Typically 6-12 years for water heater tanks, 10-15 years for tankless
   - Usually requires professional installation to remain valid
   - May be prorated (full coverage early, partial later)

2. **Labor Warranty**
   - Covers our workmanship
   - What we guarantee about the installation itself
   - Typical duration and what it includes

3. **Parts Warranty**
   - Separate from manufacturer warranty on the main unit
   - Covers components like valves, thermostats, elements

4. **Extended Warranty Options**
   - What's available beyond standard coverage
   - When it makes sense vs. when it's not worth it
   - Honest guidance (not just upselling)

**What to communicate:**
- We handle warranty claims for you
- Proper installation protects your warranty
- What voids a warranty (DIY modifications, lack of maintenance)
- Our own workmanship guarantee

### Local Codes and Permits

Building codes vary by jurisdiction. Demonstrate knowledge of local requirements.

**Water Heater Code Topics:**
- **Permit requirements** — When permits are required (new installation, relocation, fuel type change) vs. when they're not (like-for-like replacement in some jurisdictions)
- **Seismic strapping** — California requirement, specific to earthquake zones
- **Expansion tanks** — Required on closed-loop systems
- **T&P discharge requirements** — Where the relief valve must drain
- **Venting codes** — Proper exhaust for gas units, clearances
- **Gas line sizing** — Ensuring adequate supply for the unit
- **Electrical requirements** — For electric and heat pump units

**Drain/Sewer Code Topics:**
- **Cleanout requirements** — Access points required by code
- **Backflow prevention** — When required
- **Sewer lateral responsibility** — Where homeowner responsibility ends

**How to present:**
- "We handle permits so you don't have to"
- "Petaluma requires X, which many homeowners don't know"
- "Code-compliant installation protects you when you sell"
- Avoid making it sound scary—frame as "we take care of this"

### Brands We Carry

Customers often have brand preferences or want to know their options.

**What to include:**
- Brands you install and service
- Brief positioning of each (budget, mid-range, premium)
- Why you chose these brands
- Brands you can service even if you don't sell them

**Example framing:**
> "We install Rheem, Bradford White, and Navien. Each has its strengths—Rheem for reliability and value, Bradford White for commercial-grade durability, Navien for tankless efficiency. We'll help you choose based on your priorities, not ours."

**What to avoid:**
- Badmouthing competitors' brands
- Claiming one brand is universally "best"
- Hiding that you have preferences (be honest about what you recommend and why)

### Homeowner Goals

Different customers prioritize different outcomes. Address the main goals relevant to each service.

**Water Heater Goals:**

1. **Energy Efficiency**
   - Lower monthly bills
   - Environmental impact
   - Which systems deliver best efficiency

   - Prevent recurring clogs

3. **Minimal Disruption**
   - How long will this take?
   - Will you need to dig?
   - Can I use other fixtures during the work?

4. **Cost Predictability**
   - What's this going to cost?
   - Are there likely to be surprises?

**How to use goals in content:**
- Organize recommendations by goal ("If efficiency is your priority...")
- Acknowledge tradeoffs honestly ("Tankless costs more upfront but...")
- Help them identify their own priorities

### Safety Precautions and Testing

Demonstrate professionalism by explaining safety practices specific to the service.

**Water Heater Safety:**
- **Gas leak testing** — How we verify connections are safe
- **CO testing** — Checking for proper combustion and venting
- **T&P valve testing** — Verifying the safety valve operates

- "Before we leave, we test X, Y, and Z"
- "Safety checks are included, not an upsell"
- Frame as peace of mind, not fear

### Pricing Factors and Time Estimates

Help customers understand what affects cost and duration without giving specific prices that will be wrong.

**What Affects Water Heater Pricing:**
- **Type of system** — Tank vs. tankless vs. heat pump
- **Capacity/size** — Larger units cost more
- **Fuel type changes** — Gas to electric or vice versa requires more work
- **Location changes** — Moving the unit adds complexity
- **Code upgrades needed** — Bringing old installation up to current code
- **Access difficulty** — Tight spaces, stairs, attic installations
- **Permit requirements** — Varies by jurisdiction and scope

**What Affects Drain Cleaning Pricing:**
- **Location of clog** — Fixture drain vs. main line
- **Clearing method needed** — Cable vs. hydro-jet vs. excavation
- **Access availability** — Cleanouts present or need to be added
- **Root involvement** — Simple clearing vs. ongoing maintenance plan
- **Pipe condition** — May reveal need for repair/replacement

**Time Estimates:**
- **Water heater replacement:** 2-4 hours typical, longer for tankless or complex installs
- **Water heater repair:** 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the issue
- **Drain cleaning (fixture):** 30-60 minutes typical
- **Drain cleaning (main line):** 1-3 hours depending on severity and access
- **Camera inspection:** 30-60 minutes

**How to present:**
- Give ranges, not false precision
- Explain what pushes toward the higher end
- "We'll give you an exact quote before we start"
- Emphasize no-surprise pricing

### Repair vs. Replacement Decision

Help customers understand when each makes sense. This builds trust by showing you're not just pushing replacements.

**Water Heater Repair vs. Replace:**

| Factor | Lean Toward Repair | Lean Toward Replacement |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Age** | Under 8 years | Over 10-12 years |
| **Repair cost** | Under 50% of new unit | Over 50% of new unit |
| **Leak location** | Fittings, valves | Tank body itself |
| **Efficiency** | Still performing well | Noticeably higher bills |
| **History** | First major issue | Multiple recent repairs |
| **Technology** | Meets current needs | Want tankless/heat pump |

**Honest guidance language:**
- "If the tank itself is leaking, repair isn't an option—that's replacement territory."
- "A $150 thermocouple on a 5-year-old unit? Easy repair. Same repair on a 12-year-old unit? Let's talk about your options."
- "We'll tell you honestly if repair makes sense or if you're throwing good money after bad."

**Drain Cleaning Repair vs. Replace:**

| Factor | Clearing is Enough | Line Needs Repair/Replacement |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **Clog cause** | Buildup, debris | Roots, bellied pipe, collapse |
| **Frequency** | First occurrence | Recurring problem |
| **Camera findings** | Clean pipe after clearing | Damage, offsets, deterioration |
| **Pipe material** | Sound condition | Orangeburg, deteriorated clay |

### Maintenance Services

Preventive maintenance builds recurring revenue and genuinely helps customers. Present it as helpful, not salesy.

**Water Heater Maintenance:**

1. **Annual Flush**
   - Removes sediment buildup
   - Restores efficiency
   - Extends tank life
   - Especially important with hard water (Petaluma, parts of Novato)

2. **Anode Rod Inspection**
   - The "sacrificial" rod that protects the tank
   - Should be checked annually, replaced every 3-5 years
   - Extends tank life significantly

3. **T&P Valve Test**
   - Safety check
   - Verify it operates and reseats properly

4. **Combustion/Venting Check** (gas units)
   - Ensure proper operation
   - CO safety

**Drain Maintenance:**

1. **Preventive Cleaning**
   - Annual or semi-annual main line clearing
   - Especially valuable with known root issues
   - Prevents emergency backups

2. **Camera Inspection**
   - Baseline assessment of line condition
   - Early detection of developing problems

3. **Enzyme Treatments**
   - Ongoing biological maintenance
   - When it helps vs. when it's not enough

**How to present maintenance:**
- "This isn't about selling you something—it's about avoiding the 2 AM emergency"
- Give honest frequency recommendations
- Explain what maintenance actually does
- Offer maintenance plans but don't push them

## Keywords and Keyword Phrases

### Frontmatter Keywords Are Immutable

**Do not modify the keywords list in frontmatter** unless explicitly working on keyword strategy.

Keywords are strategically chosen to:
- Target gaps in competition (not just high volume)
- Minimize overlap between keyword phrases
- Maximize semantic diversity

**Why overlap is bad:** If "water heater repair" appears in 4 of 7 keywords, it looks like keyword stuffing to Google. The original keywords like "hot water tank repair," "tankless hot water repair," "water heaters repair" have minimal overlap—each targets a different search pattern.

### Natural Integration

Each service+city page has target keywords in frontmatter. Use them strategically:

- Use in the first 100 words
- Include in at least one H2 heading
- Work into image alt text
- Vary the phrasing: "drain cleaning Novato," "Novato drain cleaning," "drain cleaning service in Novato"

### Service-Specific Long-Tail Variations

**Drain cleaning:**
- "clogged drain [city]"
- "drain cleaning service [city]"
- "emergency drain cleaning [city]"
- "main line backup [city]"

**Water heaters:**
- "water heater repair [city]"
- "water heater installation [city]"
- "tankless water heater [city]"
- "water heater replacement [city]"

### Differentiation Through Keywords

Each city page should emphasize slightly different variations:
- Use city-specific terms (neighborhood names)
- Match keywords to the unique content focus
- Avoid identical keyword patterns across all pages

---

## FAQs: Service + City Specific

### Requirements

- 4-6 FAQs per page
- Questions should be specific to the service AND the city when possible
- Vary the questions between city pages (don't use identical FAQs)

### Good FAQ Examples

**Drain cleaning (city-specific):**
- "Can you help if my drain backs up during heavy rain?" (San Rafael—tidal/drainage)
- "Do you work on older Petaluma plumbing like cast iron or clay lines?" (Petaluma—historic)
- "What causes recurring clogs in Hamilton Field homes?" (Novato—military housing)

**Water heaters (city-specific):**
- "How long do water heaters last in San Rafael's coastal climate?" (corrosion factor)
- "Why does my water heater fail faster in Petaluma?" (hard water)
- "Do I need special permits for water heater replacement in Santa Rosa?" (local codes)

### FAQ Topics to Cover

1. Emergency/same-day availability
2. Repair vs. replacement decision
3. Permits and inspections
4. Specific local challenges
5. Pricing transparency

---

## Content Length Targets

**Minimum targets for competitive local SEO:**
- **Word count:** 1,500-2,500 words of unique, useful content
- **Sections:** 8-12 distinct content sections
- **Internal links:** 6-10 contextual links
- **External links:** 2-4 authoritative local resources
- **FAQs:** 4-6 service+city specific questions

Service pages can be slightly shorter than region pages because they're more focused, but they still need substantial depth to rank.

---

## On-Page SEO Checklist

For each service+city page, verify:

- [ ] **Title tag:** Service + city + brand, under 60 characters
- [ ] **Meta description:** Compelling, includes service + city, under 155 characters
- [ ] **H1:** Includes service and city naturally
- [ ] **H2s:** Include keyword variations where natural
- [ ] **URL slug:** Short, includes service and city (e.g., `/drain-cleaning-novato/`)
- [ ] **Image alt text:** Descriptive, includes service and location
- [ ] **Internal links:** To region page, other city service pages, articles
- [ ] **External links:** Water district, permits, rebates
- [ ] **Schema markup:** Service schema with city-specific details
- [ ] **Phone number:** Prominent, clickable (tel: link)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Identical phrases across pages** — Rewrite, don't copy-paste
2. **Same section order everywhere** — Vary based on city's unique challenges
3. **Generic FAQs** — Make them city-specific
4. **Missing empathy intro** — Always start with acknowledgment
5. **No link to region page** — Always cross-link
6. **Buried phone number** — Make it prominent and early
7. **No external links** — Include water district, permits
8. **Same prevention tips verbatim** — Vary the phrasing
9. **Generic plumbing language** — Speak to the specific service, not "plumbing" in general
10. **Vague repair descriptions** — Name specific repairs (thermocouple, gas valve) not just "we fix problems"

---

## Measuring Success

After revising service pages, track:

- **Rankings:** Target keywords in Google Search Console
- **Traffic:** Organic sessions to service+city pages
