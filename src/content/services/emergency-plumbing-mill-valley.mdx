faqs:
  - question: What qualifies as a plumbing emergency in Mill Valley?
    answer: >-
      Anything that can cause damage if you wait: burst pipes, sewer backups,
      active leaks you can't stop, no water at all, gas smell near plumbing.
      If you're unsure, call us—we'll help you figure out if it needs immediate
      attention or can wait until morning.
  - question: How fast can an emergency plumber get to Mill Valley?
    answer: >-
      We serve Marin County regularly and know Mill Valley's hillside roads.
      Depending on time of day and access, we can typically arrive within
      60-90 minutes. We'll give you a clear arrival window when you call.
  - question: Can you reach hillside homes with difficult access?
    answer: >-
      Yes. We work throughout Mill Valley's hillside neighborhoods regularly—
      Cascade Canyon, Homestead Valley, the slopes above downtown. We're
      equipped for stairs, narrow driveways, and tight spaces.
  - question: What should I do while waiting for the emergency plumber?
    answer: >-
      Shut off the main water valve if there's an active leak. Turn off electricity
      near affected areas. Stop using plumbing fixtures. Clear a path to the
      problem area. We'll guide you through specific steps when you call.
  - question: Do you handle gas leaks in Mill Valley?
    answer: >-
      If you smell gas, evacuate immediately and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).
      Once they've cleared the area, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line
      issues. Safety first—always.
  - question: Is there an extra charge for after-hours emergency plumbing?
    answer: >-
      Emergency rates may differ from standard service, but we're upfront about
      pricing before we start any work. No surprise fees. You'll know the cost
      before we begin.

    ## It's 2 AM. Something's Leaking. We Answer.

    The pipe behind the wall just let go. The sewer is backing up into the bathtub.
    The water heater picked Sunday morning to start flooding the garage.

    **We're that call.**

    ## What to Do Right Now

    While you wait for us, these steps can limit the damage:

    1. **Shut off the water** — Find your main shutoff valve (usually near the street or where the water line enters your home). Turn it clockwise until it stops. In hillside homes, shutoffs can be anywhere—sometimes at street level, sometimes near the house. Tam Valley homes usually have them near the sidewalk.
    2. **Turn off electricity** — If water is near outlets, switches, or your electrical panel, shut off power to affected areas at the breaker.
    3. **Stop using plumbing** — Don't flush toilets, run water, or use appliances until we assess the situation.
    4. **Contain what you can** — Towels, buckets, moving valuables out of harm's way. In multi-level hillside homes, water travels downhill fast—check lower floors.
    5. **Call us at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — We'll guide you through anything else specific to your situation.

    **Don't know where your shutoff is?** Call us anyway. Mill Valley shutoffs can be in unusual spots—we've talked many homeowners through finding theirs.

    ## Emergency Plumbing Situations We Handle in Mill Valley
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Burst or Broken Pipes
    That sound of rushing water behind the wall. The sudden drop in pressure.
    The puddle that's growing faster than you can mop.
    We locate the break, stop the water, and repair or replace the damaged section.
    Mill Valley's hillside homes and pressure variations mean we see every type of pipe failure.

    ### Sewer Backups
    When sewage comes up through floor drains, toilets, or tubs, you need someone there fast.
    We clear the blockage, assess the line condition, and make sure it's actually fixed—not just temporarily pushed through.
    The redwoods and mature trees throughout Mill Valley make root intrusion a common culprit.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Water Heater Emergencies
    The tank that's leaking all over the garage floor. The pilot that won't stay lit when you need hot water most.
    The unit that's making sounds like it's about to give up.
    Mill Valley's damp, foggy climate can accelerate corrosion on water heaters.
    We repair what can be repaired and replace what needs replacing—even at odd hours.

    ### No Water at All
    You turn on the faucet and nothing comes out. Could be a main line break, a failed pressure regulator,
    or something at the meter. Mill Valley's elevation changes create pressure extremes.
    We diagnose and restore your water supply.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Overflowing Toilets
    When the plunger isn't cutting it and water is going places it shouldn't.
    We clear the clog and check for deeper issues in the drain line.
    If it's happening on multiple fixtures, that's a main line problem—and we handle those too.

    ### Active Leaks You Can't Stop
    Under the sink, behind the wall, from the ceiling—wherever it's coming from,
    we find it and stop it. Leak detection equipment helps us locate hidden leaks
    without tearing apart your home unnecessarily.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Gas Line Issues
    **If you smell gas, evacuate and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).**
    Once the area is safe, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line problems.
    We're licensed for gas work and take these calls seriously.

    ### Flooding and Water Damage
    Whether it's a failed sump pump, a backed-up drain, or a supply line that let go,
    we stop the source and help you understand next steps for cleanup and restoration.

    ## Why Fast Response Matters in Mill Valley

    Plumbing emergencies get worse by the minute. Here's what can happen while you wait:

    - **Structural damage** — Water soaks into subfloors, drywall, and framing. In hillside homes, water can travel between floors before you even know it's there.
    - **Mold growth** — Can start within 24-48 hours. Mill Valley's fog and humidity create ideal conditions for mold once water gets into walls.
    - **Electrical hazards** — Water and electricity don't mix
    - **Contamination** — Sewer backups create health risks, especially with redwood root intrusion common in the canyons
    - **Escalating costs** — A small leak becomes a big repair

    We dispatch immediately because we know every hour matters. We serve Marin regularly and know Mill Valley's roads—even the tricky ones.
    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — let's stop the damage now.

    ## Our Emergency Process: What to Expect

    When you call us for emergency plumbing in Mill Valley, here's exactly what happens:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. You Call, We Answer
    A real person picks up—not a call center in another state.
    We ask what's happening, where you are, and give you immediate guidance
    to limit damage while we're on our way. If you're in Cascade Canyon, we're already thinking about access. Tam Valley? We're considering those 1960s galvanized lines.

    ### 2. We Dispatch Immediately
    Our trucks stay stocked for emergencies. We know Mill Valley's roads—
    the Cascade Drive switchbacks, the narrow lanes off Throckmorton, which homes require stairs. We'll tell you if we need to park and walk in.
    You get a clear arrival window, and we keep you updated if anything changes.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. We Assess and Explain
    On arrival, we diagnose the problem and explain what we're seeing.
    You'll understand what's wrong, what it takes to fix it, and what it costs
    before we start any work. No pressure, no surprises. We'll also flag any pressure or corrosion issues worth monitoring.

    ### 4. We Fix It Right
    We don't do band-aid repairs that fail next week.
    We fix the problem properly so you're not calling us again for the same issue.
    We've been working Mill Valley homes since before the freeway came through. When we leave, you can go back to your life.

    ## Mill Valley Emergency Plumbing Challenges

    Mill Valley's terrain and character create unique emergency situations:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Hillside Homes
    Cascade Canyon, Homestead Valley, the slopes above downtown—
    plumbing systems here deal with pressure variations, longer runs, and gravity challenges.
    Burst pipes on hillsides can cause significant damage before water even reaches visible areas.
    We're equipped for stairs, narrow access, and tight spaces.

    ### Downtown & Historic Areas
    The blocks around Lytton Square have plumbing from the late 1800s through early 1900s.
    Galvanized steel, cast iron, and clay sewer lines that can fail suddenly.
    We know how to work on these systems without creating new problems.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Redwood Root Intrusion
    The magnificent redwoods that define Mill Valley also send roots into sewer lines.
    Emergency backups here often involve root intrusion we can clear and address.

    ### Pressure Extremes
    Mill Valley's dramatic elevation changes—from sea level to Mt. Tam slopes—
    create pressure variations unlike anywhere else in Marin.
    PRV failures can cause sudden pressure spikes that damage pipes and fixtures.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tam Valley & Alto
    The flatter areas have different challenges—1950s-1970s tract homes
    with aging galvanized pipes and cast iron drains reaching end of life.
    Flood zone considerations in some areas.

    ### Fog and Moisture
    Mill Valley's damp climate accelerates corrosion on exposed plumbing
    and creates conditions where leaks cause mold damage quickly.
  </div>
