  ## Only Drain Solutions We Would Offer Our Own Mom

  Your drain is clogged, backed up, or making sounds that drains shouldn't make.
  Maybe a crazed squirrel crawled in, some kid shoved their favorite Lego creation down the toilet,
  or that beautiful tree has taken a liking to the liquid inside your sewer line.

  Whatever it is, we will find your clogged drain problem and clear it.
  We've cleared thousands of drains—kitchen sinks, shower drains, main sewer lines, root-infested pipes.
  Whatever's wrong with yours, we'll find it and fix it.

  **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** and we'll get your drains flowing again.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ## What to Do Right Now

  If your drain is acting up, here's what to do while you wait for us:

  - **Water rising or threatening to overflow?** Stop using that fixture immediately.
  - **Multiple drains backing up at once?** That signals a main line issue—call us now.
  - **Avoid chemical drain cleaners.** They often don't solve the problem and can make repairs harder.
  - **Sewage smell?** Don't ignore it—could be a venting issue or a bigger problem.

  ## Common Drain Clearing Jobs We Handle
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### The Clogs We Clear Every Week

  Most drain problems come down to a handful of common causes.
  We carry the equipment for these on our trucks because we see them so often:

  - **Kitchen sink clogs** — Grease buildup, food debris, disposal issues. The #1 call we get.
  - **Bathroom sink clogs** — Hair, soap scum, toothpaste buildup in the P-trap.
  - **Shower and tub drains** — Hair is usually the culprit. Sometimes it's deeper in the line.
  - **Toilet clogs** — Paper, wipes (even "flushable" ones), or objects that shouldn't be there.
  - **Floor drains** — Basement and garage drains that back up from debris or root intrusion.
  - **Main sewer line** — When multiple fixtures back up, the problem is in the main line.

  **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** or see [24/7 emergency plumbing](/emergency-plumbing-services/) for urgent situations.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Root Removal and Sewer Line Issues

  Trees love sewer lines. The moisture and nutrients attract roots,
  and once they find a crack or joint, they grow inside the pipe.

  **Signs of root intrusion:**
  - Recurring clogs in the same drain
  - Slow drains throughout the house
  - Gurgling sounds from toilets
  - Sewage smell in the yard

  We use root-cutting equipment to clear the intrusion and camera inspection to assess the damage.
  Sometimes clearing is enough. Sometimes the line needs repair. We'll tell you honestly which situation you're in.
</div>

<div class="one-column">
  ## How We Clear Your Drain
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Our Process

  1. **We ask questions first** — Which drains are affected? When did it start? Any recent changes?
  2. **We diagnose before we dig in** — Camera inspection when needed to see exactly what's causing the problem.
  3. **We match the tool to the problem** — Cable machine, hydro-jet, or root cutter depending on what we find.
  4. **We verify it's clear** — Running water, camera confirmation, making sure it's actually fixed.
  5. **We explain what we found** — And what it means for the future.

  No guessing. No brute-force shortcuts. Just the right solution for your specific clog.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### The Tools We Use

  We use professional equipment matched to the problem:

  - **Cable machines (snakes)** — For most clogs. Breaks through blockages mechanically.
  - **Hydro-jetting** — High-pressure water that scours the pipe clean. Best for grease buildup and scale.
  - **Video camera inspection** — See exactly what's in the pipe before and after clearing.
  - **Root cutting equipment** — Mechanical cutters that remove root intrusion without damaging the pipe.

  We don't use the biggest tool every time—we use the right tool.
  A simple cable clearing doesn't need hydro-jetting. But stubborn grease buildup does.

<div class="one-column">
  ## Clearing vs. Repair: When Each Makes Sense
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### When Clearing Is Enough

  Most drain calls are clearing jobs. The pipe is fine—it just has something in it that needs to come out.

  **Clearing usually makes sense when:**
  - It's the first time this drain has clogged
  - The clog is from normal buildup (hair, grease, debris)
  - Camera inspection shows a clean pipe after clearing
  - No signs of pipe damage or deterioration
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### When the Line Needs Repair

  Sometimes clearing reveals a bigger problem. We'll tell you honestly when that's the case.

  **Repair or replacement usually makes sense when:**
  - The same drain clogs repeatedly (every few months)
  - Camera shows root intrusion, bellied pipe, or collapse
  - Pipe material is deteriorated (Orangeburg, old clay, corroded cast iron)
  - Offsets or breaks are visible on camera

  We don't push repairs you don't need. But we won't pretend clearing will fix a broken pipe.

<div class="two-column">
  ## What Affects Pricing

  We give upfront pricing before any work begins. Here's what affects the quote:

  - **Location of clog** — Fixture drain vs. main line (main line takes longer)
  - **Clearing method needed** — Cable vs. hydro-jet vs. root cutting
  - **Access** — Is there a cleanout? Or do we need to pull a toilet?
  - **Severity** — Simple hair clog vs. years of grease buildup
  - **Camera inspection** — Recommended for recurring clogs or main line issues

  **Typical timeframes:**
  - Fixture drain clearing: 30-60 minutes
  - Main line clearing: 1-3 hours depending on access and severity
  - Camera inspection: 30-60 minutes
  - Hydro-jetting: 1-2 hours
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ## Preventing Future Clogs

  **Good habits:**
  - Use drain strainers in showers and tubs
  - Run hot water after using the kitchen sink
  - Never pour grease down the drain (wipe pans with paper towel first)
  - Only flush toilet paper—no wipes, even "flushable" ones

  **Maintenance that helps:**
  - Annual main line clearing if you have trees near your sewer line
  - Enzyme treatments for kitchen drains (we can recommend products)
  - Camera inspection every few years to catch problems early

  A little prevention saves a lot of emergency calls.

  ## What we don't do (a nefarious plumber story)

  We were called to a home with a clogged drain.
  Turns out the homeowner had had another plumber from a fairly well known company out multiple times.
  They had spent way too much time trying to clear the clog,
  and had claimed the drains in the home needed to be replumbed—tearing open walls and floors for all new pipes.
  When the homeowner saw the price, they correctly decided to get a second opinion.

  We came out, cleared the vent to the sink that had been clogged, and everything was flowing after that.
  Unfortunately, we are are called out to jobs where less than scrupulous plumbers are trying to take advantage of homeowners.
  We love getting those calls because we can set it right.
  But, we would rather these nefarious plumbers stop giving plumbers a bad name.

  ## Frequently Asked Questions
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### How do I know if it's a clog or a bigger problem?

  If one drain is slow, it's probably a local clog. If multiple drains are backing up—especially
  when you flush a toilet or run the washing machine—that's a main line issue.
  Camera inspection can tell us exactly what's going on.

  ### Should I use chemical drain cleaners?

  We don't recommend them. They rarely solve the actual problem, can damage pipes over time,
  and make our job harder (and more dangerous) when we arrive. Hot water and a plunger are safer first steps.

  ### How often should drains be cleaned?

  Most drains don't need regular cleaning if you have good habits.
  But if you have trees near your sewer line, annual main line clearing can prevent backups.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### What's the difference between snaking and hydro-jetting?

  Snaking (cable machine) breaks through the clog mechanically. It's effective for most blockages.
  Hydro-jetting uses high-pressure water to scour the entire pipe clean—better for grease buildup,
  scale, or when you want a thorough cleaning, not just a hole through the clog.

  ### How long does drain clearing take?

  Fixture drains: 30-60 minutes. Main line: 1-3 hours depending on access and severity.
  We'll give you a time estimate before we start.

  ### Do you offer camera inspection?

  Yes. We recommend it for recurring clogs, main line issues, or when we want to verify
  the line is clear and undamaged. It's the only way to know for sure what's in the pipe.
