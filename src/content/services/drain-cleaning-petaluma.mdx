faqs:
  - question: "How do I know if a clog is in my fixture or the main line?"
    answer: "If only one sink/shower is slow, it may be a localized clog. If multiple fixtures are backing up (or a downstairs drain backs up when you run water upstairs), that often points to a main line issue. Stop running water and call us so we can prevent a bigger backup."
  - question: "Do you work on older Petaluma plumbing like cast iron or clay lines?"
    answer: "Yes. Older systems often need a more careful approach. We’ll choose the right method for your pipe type, explain the plan, and avoid unnecessary damage—especially in historic homes and buildings."
  - question: "What causes recurring clogs?"
    answer: "Common causes include grease buildup, roots, pipe scale, a belly (sag) in the line, or a damaged section. If a clog keeps returning, a camera inspection can show us the real cause so we can recommend the right fix."
  - question: "Is hydro-jetting safe for my pipes?"
    answer: "It depends on the pipe type and condition. Hydro-jetting is excellent for heavy buildup, but we won’t use it when it’s not appropriate. We’ll recommend the safest option that solves the problem and reduces repeat clogs."
  - question: "Can you help if my kitchen drain keeps clogging?"
    answer: "Yes. Kitchen lines often clog from grease and food buildup. We can clear the blockage and, if needed, clean the line so it drains well—then give you simple prevention steps that actually work."
