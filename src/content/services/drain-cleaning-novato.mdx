faqs:
  - question: "What are the first signs a drain clog is getting worse?"
    answer: "Slow draining, gurgling, odors, or water backing up in a different fixture than the one you used. If you notice multiple fixtures acting up, it can be a main line issue—call us before it becomes a backup."
  - question: "Can you clear drains without making a mess?"
    answer: "Yes. We protect the area, work clean, and clean up after. We'll also explain what we're doing before we do it—especially if we need to use a cleanout or camera."
  - question: "Do you offer camera inspection for recurring clogs?"
    answer: "Yes. When a clog keeps coming back, a camera inspection helps us find the real cause (buildup, roots, a belly in the line, or a damaged section) so we can recommend the right fix."
  - question: "Is hydro-jetting always necessary?"
    answer: "No. Sometimes a professional cable/snake is the right tool. Hydro-jetting is great for heavy buildup and restoring full pipe diameter, but we choose the method based on your pipe type and the problem we see."
  - question: "Do you provide emergency drain cleaning in Novato?"
    answer: "Yes. If you have an active backup or no-drain situation, call us and we'll give you a clear arrival window."

    hat-in-hand and ready to roll. [Call us now at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)
    and we will get your day back on track starting now.

    We appreciate the call and will answer with **service that protects you and your home**

    another less experienced or respectful plumber.

    Novato's plumbing tells the story of Marin County's evolution—from 1940s military housing
    at Hamilton Field to vintage Old Town cottages to modern San Marin developments.
    Each era brought different materials and methods. We know what works for each.

    ## Take These Steps Right Now
    1. **Call GoFlow Plumbing at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—we're ready to move.
    2. If multiple fixtures are backing up, stop using water immediately—this signals a main line issue.

    Novato sits at the crossroads of Marin County—where suburban development meets
    rural Marin, where Sonoma County water meets Marin Municipal. We understand these
    transitions because we've been working here for three generations. The soil conditions
    in Ignacio Valley. The military-era plumbing issues at Hamilton. The mature oak roots
    in established neighborhoods. We know what we're walking into before we arrive and 
    we bring the professional drain cleaning service Novato trusts.

    **Its our mission to fix your drain. Please, [give us a call at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350).**

    ## Why Novato Keeps Calling Us Back

    Not for the same clog—we fix those permanently. They call us back because when something
    else goes wrong, they remember how we handled the last job.

    **We've been here through it all.** Three generations watching Hamilton transform from
    military base to family neighborhood. Watching Novato grow into Marin's largest city by area.
    We know this place because we've been part of it for decades.

    **We understand what makes Novato different.** The 1940s plumbing quirks at Hamilton.
    The clay soil challenges in Ignacio Valley. The mature oaks with roots that seek out pipe joints.
    We account for all of it.

    **What we quote is what you pay.** No creative billing. No invented problems.
    Just honest work at a fair price.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's solve this.**

    ## What We Clear in Novato Homes

    From Hamilton to San Marin, we've unclogged every type of drain Novato can throw at us:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bathroom Backups
    - Toilets that won't budge with a plunger
    - Shower floors filling up while you're in them
    - Tubs that drain at a crawl
    - Sinks making gurgling protests
    - Multiple fixtures failing together
    - Soap scum and hair buildup
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Kitchen Disasters
    - Disposals that jam or won't drain
    - Sinks you can't use because they're full
    - Dishwasher water with nowhere to go
    - Clogs that keep returning
    - Grease buildup from years of cooking
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Utility & Laundry
    - Washing machine floods mid-cycle
    - Utility sinks that won't empty
    - Garage drains backing up
    - Sump and drainage problems
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Main Sewer Line
    - Whole-house backup symptoms
    - Sewer odors you can't explain
    - Those mature Novato oaks finding your pipes
    - Cracked, collapsed, or settling lines
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Our Process: No Guessing, Just Results

    Novato's mix of eras—military housing, vintage cottages, modern developments—means
    we can't use a one-size-fits-all approach. Here's how we actually work:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. Figure Out What's Wrong
    We run water, check fixtures, and listen to your system. Is this one clog or a bigger issue?
    Cameras go in when we need to see what's happening deep in the line. No guessing.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 2. Tell You What We Found
    Before we touch anything, you'll know what's going on and what it costs.
    Plain English. No jargon. You decide what makes sense.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. Clear the Blockage
    Cable machines for routine clogs. Hydro jetting for heavy buildup. Root cutters for those
    Novato oaks that find every pipe joint. We keep at it until the line runs clear.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 4. Confirm and Advise
    We verify flow is restored, then share tips to prevent future problems.
    If we spotted something concerning, we'll mention it—but we don't push repairs you don't need.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## 2 AM on a Tuesday? We Answer.

    Drain disasters pick the worst times. Sewage doesn't care that it's Thanksgiving morning.
    Neither do we. Our trucks stay ready, and we know Novato's streets well enough to get there fast.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) any hour. Seriously.**

    ## Novato's Unique Drain Challenges

    Novato's history as a small town that grew into Marin's northernmost city means
    we encounter plumbing from every era. Here's what makes drain cleaning here different:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Hamilton Field
    Former military base with 1940s infrastructure converted to residential. Unique layouts,
    original systems mixed with retrofits, and drainage patterns from the base days.
    We've worked Hamilton for decades—we know what we're walking into.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Old Town Novato
    Vintage cottages with original drain systems. Mature landscaping with aggressive roots.
    Narrow lots with limited access. We use heritage-conscious techniques that don't destroy
    what makes these homes special.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### San Marin & Ignacio Valley
    1970s-80s developments with clay-heavy soil that stresses pipes. Those trees planted
    40 years ago? Their roots are now finding every pipe joint. Multi-level homes with
    gravity-dependent drainage that gets complicated.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Indian Valley & Rural Areas
    Larger lots, septic systems, well water. Different considerations than city plumbing.
    We know the difference and adjust our approach accordingly.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## How to Avoid Calling Us (We Won't Take It Personally)
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Smart Moves:
    - Strainers in every drain—cheap and effective
    - Cold water while the disposal runs
    - Deal with slow drains before they stop completely
    - Annual maintenance if you've had recurring issues
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Stuff That Causes Problems:
    - Grease down the drain (it hardens and catches everything)
    - "Flushable" wipes (spoiler: they're not)
    - Chemical drain cleaners (they eat your pipes)
    - That gurgling sound you've been ignoring
  </div>
