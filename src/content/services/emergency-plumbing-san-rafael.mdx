faqs:
  - question: What qualifies as a plumbing emergency in San Rafael?
    answer: >-
      Anything that can cause damage if you wait: burst pipes, sewer backups,
      active leaks you can't stop, no water at all, gas smell near plumbing.
      If you're unsure, call us—we'll help you figure out if it needs immediate
      attention or can wait until morning.
  - question: How fast can an emergency plumber get to San Rafael?
    answer: >-
      We serve Marin County regularly and know the area well. Depending on time
      of day and traffic, we can typically arrive within 60-90 minutes. We'll
      give you a clear arrival window when you call.
  - question: Is there an extra charge for after-hours emergency plumbing in San Rafael?
    answer: >-
      Emergency rates may differ from standard service, but we're upfront about
      pricing before we start any work. No surprise fees. You'll know the cost
      before we begin.
  - question: What should I do while waiting for the emergency plumber?
    answer: >-
      Shut off the main water valve if there's an active leak. Turn off electricity
      near affected areas. Stop using plumbing fixtures. Clear a path to the
      problem area. We'll guide you through specific steps when you call.
  - question: Do you handle gas leaks in San Rafael?
    answer: >-
      If you smell gas, evacuate immediately and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).
      Once they've cleared the area, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line
      issues. Safety first—always.
  - question: Can I wait until morning for a plumbing problem?
    answer: >-
      It depends. A dripping faucet? Sure. A burst pipe flooding your home?
      Absolutely not. Sewer backing up into your house? Call now. When in doubt,
      call us and we'll help you decide—no charge for the conversation.

    ## It's 2 AM. Something's Leaking. We Answer.

    The pipe behind the wall just let go. The sewer is backing up into the bathtub.

    ## What to Do Right Now

    While you wait for us, these steps can limit the damage:

    1. **Shut off the water** — Find your main shutoff valve (usually near the street or where the water line enters your home). Turn it clockwise until it stops. In Terra Linda tract homes, it's typically near the front sidewalk. Hillside homes often have shutoffs in unexpected places—we can help you find it.
    2. **Turn off electricity** — If water is near outlets, switches, or your electrical panel, shut off power to affected areas at the breaker.
    3. **Stop using plumbing** — Don't flush toilets, run water, or use appliances until we assess the situation.
    4. **Contain what you can** — Towels, buckets, moving valuables out of harm's way. San Rafael's hillside homes can have water travel to lower floors quickly.
    5. **Call us at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — We'll guide you through anything else specific to your situation.

    **Don't know where your shutoff is?** Call us anyway. We've helped plenty of San Rafael homeowners find theirs over the phone while we're en route.

    ## Emergency Plumbing Situations We Handle in San Rafael
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Burst or Broken Pipes
    That sound of rushing water behind the wall. The sudden drop in pressure.
    The puddle that's growing faster than you can mop.
    We locate the break, stop the water, and repair or replace the damaged section.
    San Rafael's hillside homes and older downtown properties each present different pipe challenges.

    ### Sewer Backups
    When sewage comes up through floor drains, toilets, or tubs, you need someone there fast.
    We clear the blockage, assess the line condition, and make sure it's actually fixed—not just temporarily pushed through.
    Terra Linda's mature trees and downtown's aging infrastructure make root intrusion common.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Water Heater Emergencies
    The tank that's leaking all over the garage floor. The pilot that won't stay lit when you need hot water most.
    The unit that's making sounds like it's about to give up.
    We repair what can be repaired and replace what needs replacing—even at odd hours.

    ### No Water at All
    You turn on the faucet and nothing comes out. Could be a main line break, a failed pressure regulator,
    or something at the meter. We diagnose and restore your water supply.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Overflowing Toilets
    When the plunger isn't cutting it and water is going places it shouldn't.
    We clear the clog and check for deeper issues in the drain line.
    If it's happening on multiple fixtures, that's a main line problem—and we handle those too.

    ### Active Leaks You Can't Stop
    Under the sink, behind the wall, from the ceiling—wherever it's coming from,
    we find it and stop it. Leak detection equipment helps us locate hidden leaks
    without tearing apart your home unnecessarily.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Gas Line Issues
    **If you smell gas, evacuate and call PG&E first (1-800-743-5000).**
    Once the area is safe, we can repair the plumbing side of gas line problems.
    We're licensed for gas work and take these calls seriously.

    ### Flooding and Water Damage
    Whether it's a failed sump pump, a backed-up drain, or a supply line that let go,
    we stop the source and help you understand next steps for cleanup and restoration.

    ## Why Fast Response Matters in San Rafael

    Plumbing emergencies get worse by the minute. Here's what can happen while you wait:

    - **Structural damage** — Water soaks into subfloors, drywall, and framing. In hillside homes, water can travel between floors before you even see it.
    - **Mold growth** — Can start within 24-48 hours. San Rafael's bay-influenced humidity makes mold a real concern once water gets into walls.
    - **Electrical hazards** — Water and electricity don't mix
    - **Contamination** — Sewer backups create health risks, particularly in homes with older clay laterals common in downtown San Rafael
    - **Escalating costs** — A small leak becomes a big repair

    We dispatch immediately because we know every hour matters. We serve Marin regularly—no bridge traffic delays.
    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — let's stop the damage now.

    ## Our Emergency Process: What to Expect

    When you call us for emergency plumbing in San Rafael, here's exactly what happens:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 1. You Call, We Answer
    A real person picks up—not a call center in another state.
    We ask what's happening, where you are, and give you immediate guidance
    to limit damage while we're on our way. If you're in Terra Linda, we're thinking about those 1960s galvanized lines. Downtown? We're already considering cast iron.

    ### 2. We Dispatch Immediately
    Our trucks stay stocked for emergencies. We know Marin County's roads—the Lucas Valley shortcut, the back way through Northgate, which streets get congested during commute hours.
    You get a clear arrival window, and we keep you updated if anything changes.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### 3. We Assess and Explain
    On arrival, we diagnose the problem and explain what we're seeing.
    You'll understand what's wrong, what it takes to fix it, and what it costs
    before we start any work. No pressure, no surprises. We'll also mention if we spot something that's not urgent but worth monitoring.

    ### 4. We Fix It Right
    We don't do band-aid repairs that fail next week.
    We fix the problem properly so you're not calling us again for the same issue.
    We've worked on San Rafael homes for decades—some we've visited multiple times as different families moved through. When we leave, you can go back to your life.

    ## San Rafael Emergency Plumbing Challenges

    San Rafael's geography and housing stock create unique emergency situations:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Hillside Homes
    San Rafael's hills—from Terra Linda to the slopes above downtown—mean plumbing systems
    deal with pressure variations, longer runs, and gravity challenges.
    Burst pipes on hillsides can cause significant damage before water even reaches visible areas.

    ### Downtown & Historic Areas
    Older San Rafael neighborhoods have plumbing from the early 1900s through mid-century.
    Galvanized steel, cast iron, and clay sewer lines that can fail suddenly after decades of service.
    We know how to work on these systems without creating new problems.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Coastal Influence
    San Rafael's proximity to the bay means higher humidity and salt air.
    This accelerates corrosion on exposed plumbing components and can shorten
    the life of water heaters and outdoor fixtures.

    ### Terra Linda & Northgate
    Post-war tract homes with 50-70 year old plumbing systems.
    Original galvanized supply lines reaching end of life.
    PRVs (pressure reducing valves) that fail and cause pressure-related emergencies.
  </div>
