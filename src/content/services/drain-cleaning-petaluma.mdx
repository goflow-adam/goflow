faqs:
  - question: "How do I know if a clog is in my fixture or the main line?"
    answer: "If only one sink/shower is slow, it may be a localized clog. If multiple fixtures are backing up (or a downstairs drain backs up when you run water upstairs), that often points to a main line issue. Stop running water and call us so we can prevent a bigger backup."
  - question: "Do you work on older Petaluma plumbing like cast iron or clay lines?"
    answer: "Yes. Older systems often need a more careful approach. We’ll choose the right method for your pipe type, explain the plan, and avoid unnecessary damage—especially in historic homes and buildings."
  - question: "What causes recurring clogs?"
    answer: "Common causes include grease buildup, roots, pipe scale, a belly (sag) in the line, or a damaged section. If a clog keeps returning, a camera inspection can show us the real cause so we can recommend the right fix."
  - question: "Is hydro-jetting safe for my pipes?"
    answer: "It depends on the pipe type and condition. Hydro-jetting is excellent for heavy buildup, but we won’t use it when it’s not appropriate. We’ll recommend the safest option that solves the problem and reduces repeat clogs."
  - question: "Can you help if my kitchen drain keeps clogging?"
    answer: "Yes. Kitchen lines often clog from grease and food buildup. We can clear the blockage and, if needed, clean the line so it drains well—then give you simple prevention steps that actually work."

    **Your clogged drain just became our problem to solve.**<br />
    That backed-up sink, the shower that won't drain, the toilet that keeps overflowing—we're
    already grabbing our gear. [Call us now at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)
    and will get your day back on track starting now.

    **We refuse to let you end up with a pseudo-fixed drain.**
    Too many Petaluma homeowners have called us after another company "cleared" a clog
    that came right back. We don't just push the problem down the line—we find the real
    cause and fix it properly. That's the only way we know how to work.

    ## Take These Steps Right Now
    1. **Call GoFlow Plumbing at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—we're ready to move.
    2. If multiple fixtures are backing up, stop using water immediately—this signals a main line issue.
    3. If there's active overflow, protect the area and avoid chemical drain cleaners (they often make things worse).
    4. If it's a single slow drain, we can still help—especially if it keeps coming back.

    We'll handle everything else from here.

    ## A Drain Cleaning Methodology of Respect

    Drop cloths and shoe covers are just the start of the respect we show your home.
    We treat your home like our own mom's.
    When we leave, **your home will be cleaner than when we arrived.**
    We walk you through every option—honest guidance from plumbers who genuinely want
    the best outcome for you, not the biggest invoice.

    Some clogs need a simple cable clearing. Some need a camera inspection to find the real cause.
    Some need hydro jetting when buildup is the culprit. We'll explain what we recommend and why,
    then do the work cleanly and carefully—especially in older Petaluma plumbing where the wrong
    approach can cause expensive damage.

    Three generations of our family have been providing drain cleaning services in Petaluma.
    We know the clay soil issues, the heritage tree root patterns, and exactly what your home needs.
    This isn't just a job for us—it's our craft.

    **Ready to get this solved? [Give us a call at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350).**

    ## How We Get Your Drains Flowing

    No guesswork. No trial and error. Just a proven approach that works:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Step 1: Find the Problem
    We check your drains, run water tests, and look at multiple fixtures to figure out
    if this is a single clog or something affecting your whole system.
    If we need to see inside your pipes, we'll run a camera.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Step 2: Explain Everything
    You'll know exactly what we found and what we recommend before we pick up a tool.
    We quote the price upfront. No games, no hidden fees.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Step 3: Clear It Out
    Cable machine for straightforward clogs. Hydro jetting for stubborn buildup.
    Root cutters when Petaluma's heritage trees have found their way in.
    We keep at it until the line is truly clear.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Step 4: Confirm and Advise
    We run water to verify everything flows freely, then share tips to keep it that way.
    If we spotted something bigger during the job, we'll mention it—but we won't push work you don't need.

    ## Why Petaluma Calls Us First

    We fix drains so they stay fixed. When we pack up and leave, you shouldn't have to
    think about that drain again for years. That's the standard we hold ourselves to.

    **Petaluma is home.** Three generations of our family have worked these streets.
    We know which neighborhoods have clay pipes, which have cast iron, and which have
    root problems from those beautiful heritage oaks. We don't guess—we know.

    **We've seen every shortcut fail.** Other plumbers punch through clogs and call it done.
    We've been called to re-fix those jobs too many times. We'd rather do it right once.

    **The price we quote is the price you pay.** No surprise line items. No "while we're here"
    upsells. Just honest work at a fair price.

    ## Simple Habits That Prevent Clogs
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Good Moves:
    - Put strainers in every drain (cheap insurance)
    - Flush the disposal with hot water after each use
    - Get ahead of recurring problems with a maintenance visit
    - Don't wait on slow drains—they only get worse
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Avoid These:
    - Grease down the drain (it solidifies and catches everything)
    - "Flushable" wipes (they're not, really)
    - Chemical drain cleaners (they eat your pipes)
    - Ignoring gurgling sounds (that's your drain asking for help)
