    ## Water Heater Issues
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ### My Hot Water is Gone

    No hot water at all? Could be a failed heating element, pilot light issue, or the unit itself has failed.

    **Common causes:**
    - Pilot light went out (gas units)
    - Heating element failed (electric units)
    - Thermostat malfunction
    - Gas supply issue
    - Unit has reached end of life

  <div class="two-column">
    ### Water Heater Leaking

    Water pooling around your water heater needs attention. Small drips can become floods.

    **Common causes:**
    - Pressure relief valve discharge
    - Tank corrosion (internal leak)
    - Inlet/outlet connection leak
    - Drain valve leak

    **[Water Heater Repair & Replacement →](/water-heater-repair-and-replacement/)**
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">

    **Options we install:**
    - Traditional tank water heaters
    - Tankless (on-demand) water heaters

    **[Water Heater Installation →](/water-heater-install/)**
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ### Not Enough Hot Water

    Running out of hot water too quickly? The tank may be undersized, or there's a problem with the heating system.

    **Common causes:**
    - Sediment buildup in tank
    - Failing heating element
    - Thermostat set too low
    - Tank too small for household
    - Dip tube failure

    ## Drain Problems
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ### My Drain is Clogged

    Water won't go down, or it's draining very slowly. Could be a simple clog or something deeper in the line.

    **Common causes:**
    - Hair and soap buildup
    - Grease accumulation
    - Foreign objects
    - Root intrusion (main line)
    - Pipe damage or collapse

    **[Clogged Drains & Rooter Service →](/clogged-drains-rootered/)**
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ### Toilet Backed Up

    Toilet won't flush or is overflowing. Could be a simple clog or a main line issue.

    **Common causes:**
    - Too much toilet paper
    - Foreign objects flushed
    - Main sewer line backup
    - Partial blockage in trap

    **[Clogged or Running Toilets →](/clogged-or-running-toilets/)**
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ### My Drain Stinks

    Bad smells coming from drains usually indicate a problem with the trap, vent, or something stuck in the line.

    **Common causes:**
    - Dry P-trap (run water to refill)
    - Biofilm buildup in pipes
    - Blocked vent pipe
    - Partial clog decomposing

    **Common causes:**
    - Reset button tripped
    - Jammed flywheel
    - Motor burnout
    - Electrical issue
    - Worn grinding components

    **[Garbage Disposal Repair & Installation →](/garbage-disposal-repair-or-installation/)**

    ### Multiple Drains Backing Up

    When more than one drain is slow or backing up, the problem is likely in your main sewer line.

    **Common causes:**
    - Main line blockage
    - Root intrusion
    - Collapsed or damaged pipe
    - Septic tank full (if applicable)

    ## Leaks & Pipes
  </div>

    - Roof leak (not plumbing)
    - Condensation from pipes
