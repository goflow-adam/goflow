faqs:
  - question: How quickly can you respond to a water heater emergency in Sonoma?
    answer: >-
      We're based in Sonoma County, so we can typically respond same-day for
      water heater emergencies—no hot water, active leaks, or gas smell. Call us
      and we'll give you a clear arrival window.
  - question: How does Sonoma's water quality affect my water heater?
    answer: >-
      Sonoma's water has moderate mineral content that causes sediment buildup
      in tank water heaters over time. Annual flushing extends equipment life
      and maintains efficiency. Properties on wells may have additional
      considerations.
  - question: Should I repair or replace my water heater?
    answer: >-
      It depends on age, repair cost, and the nature of the problem. If the tank
      itself is leaking, replacement is the only option. For other issues, we'll
      give you an honest assessment of whether repair makes sense or if
      replacement is the better investment.
  - question: Do you install tankless water heaters in Sonoma?
    answer: >-
      Yes. We install and service both tank and tankless systems. Tankless
      requires adequate gas supply and proper venting—we assess your home's
      setup and handle any upgrades needed.

    ## Need Water Heater Repair in Sonoma? We're On It.

    Maybe the water heater gave up completely—no hot water at all.

    Maybe there's water pooling underneath it and you're not sure how bad it's going to get.

    Whatever's happening, you need it fixed. Not tomorrow, not "sometime this week."

    You're in Sonoma, and so are we. **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** for water heater repair in Sonoma.

    ## What to Do Right Now

    1. **You've called us at [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—good. We're on our way.
    2. **Leaking?** Find the cold water shutoff valve on top of the tank. Turn it clockwise to stop the water.
    3. **Smell gas?** Get everyone outside immediately. Call PG&E from outside before doing anything else.
    4. **Tank cracked?** Don't run any hot water—it increases pressure and makes things worse.

    Sit tight. We know Sonoma and we'll be there soon.

    ## How We Handle Water Heater Service in Sonoma CA
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Our Process

    1. **Diagnose the actual problem** — Not just the symptom, but the cause
    2. **Explain your options clearly** — Repair vs. replace, with honest cost comparisons
    3. **Quote before we start** — No surprises on the bill
    4. **Complete the work** — Whether repair or installation, done right the first time
    5. **Test thoroughly** — Temperature, pressure, connections, safety devices
    6. **Clean up completely** — You won't know we were there except for the working water heater

    We don't push replacements when repair makes sense. We don't recommend band-aids when replacement is the smarter investment.

    **Tip:** If your water heater is over 10 years old and needs a repair costing more than $400, replacement is usually the better value.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### What We Repair

    **No hot water** — Could be the thermocouple, gas valve, heating element, or thermostat. We diagnose and fix.

    **Not enough hot water** — Sediment buildup, failing dip tube, or undersized unit. We identify the cause.

    **Strange noises** — Rumbling, popping, or crackling usually means sediment buildup. A flush often solves it.

    **Leaks** — From fittings, valves, or connections we can repair. From the tank itself, that's replacement.

    **Pilot light won't stay lit** — Usually thermocouple or gas valve. Common repair, usually same-day.

    **Temperature fluctuations** — Thermostat issues, sediment, or mixing valve problems.

    **Rusty water** — Could be the anode rod (replaceable) or the tank itself (replacement time).

    ## Choosing the Right Water Heater in Sonoma for Your Home
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tank Water Heaters

    The traditional choice: a storage tank that keeps 30-80 gallons of water hot and ready.

    **Why they work well in Sonoma:**
    - Reliable technology with decades of track record
    - Lower upfront cost than alternatives
    - Work with existing gas lines and venting in most homes
    - Sonoma's moderate water hardness is manageable with annual flushing

    **Considerations:**
    - 8-12 year typical lifespan
    - Standby energy loss (heating water you're not using)
    - Takes up floor space

    **Best for:** Predictable hot water usage, budget-conscious homeowners, homes with existing tank setups.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tankless Water Heaters

    Wall-mounted units that heat water on demand—no storage tank, no standby loss.

    **Why they work well in Sonoma:**
    - Endless hot water for larger households or guest situations
    - 20+ year lifespan with proper maintenance
    - Space savings in smaller homes or tight utility areas
    - 30% energy savings over tank heaters

    **Considerations:**
    - Higher upfront cost
    - May require gas line upgrade for adequate BTU supply
    - Needs proper venting (often different from tank venting)
    - Sonoma's water hardness requires annual descaling

    **Best for:** High hot water demand, space constraints, long-term efficiency focus.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Heat Pump Water Heaters

    Extract heat from ambient air to heat water—2-3x more efficient than standard tanks.

    **Why they work well in Sonoma:**
    - Sonoma's mild climate is ideal—these units struggle below 40°F, which is rare here
    - Significant energy savings (up to 70% reduction)
    - Qualify for substantial rebates (Sonoma Clean Power, federal tax credits)
    - Bonus: they dehumidify the space around them

    **Considerations:**
    - Need space around them for air circulation
    - Higher upfront cost (offset by rebates and savings)
    - Slightly slower recovery than gas units

    **Best for:** Efficiency-focused homeowners, those with garage or basement installation space.

    ## Comparing Your Options

    | System | Upfront Cost | Energy Savings | Lifespan | Best For |
    |--------|--------------|----------------|----------|----------|
    | Tank (gas) | $ | Moderate | 8-12 yrs | Predictable usage, budget |
    | Tank (electric) | $ | Lower | 8-12 yrs | No gas available |
    | Tankless | $$$ | High (30%) | 20+ yrs | High demand, space savings |
    | Heat Pump | $$$ | Very High (70%) | 10-15 yrs | Efficiency, rebate eligible |

    Not sure which fits your situation? We'll assess your home, your hot water usage, and your priorities—then recommend accordingly.

    ## What Affects Water Heater Costs in Sonoma?

    | Factor | How It Affects Cost |
    |--------|---------------------|
    | **System type** | Tank is least expensive; tankless and heat pump cost more upfront |
    | **Capacity** | Larger tanks and higher-output tankless units cost more |
    | **Fuel type change** | Switching from electric to gas (or vice versa) requires additional work |
    | **Location change** | Moving the water heater adds complexity |
    | **Code upgrades** | Older installations may need updating (expansion tank, seismic straps, venting) |
    | **Access** | Tight spaces, attics, or difficult locations increase labor |

    ## Sonoma's Water and Your Water Heater in Sonoma
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Valley of the Moon Water District

    Most Sonoma homes are served by <a href="https://www.vomwd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valley of the Moon Water District</a>.
    The water has moderate mineral content—not extremely hard, but enough to cause sediment buildup over time.

    **What this means for your water heater:**
    - Sediment accumulates at the bottom of tank water heaters
    - Buildup reduces efficiency (your heater works harder to heat through the sediment layer)
    - Rumbling or popping sounds indicate significant buildup
    - Annual flushing extends tank life and maintains efficiency

    **Tip:** If your water heater is making noise, a sediment flush is the first thing to try. It's inexpensive and often solves the problem.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Properties on Private Wells

    Some Sonoma Valley properties—especially estates and rural homes—are on private wells rather than VOMWD water.

    Well water quality varies dramatically:
    - Some wells produce soft, clean water
    - Others have high mineral content, iron, or sulfur
    - Hard well water accelerates sediment buildup and shortens water heater life

    If you're on a well and your water heaters seem to fail faster than expected, water quality is likely a factor.
    Testing and treatment options exist—we can discuss what makes sense for your situation.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ### Plaza-Area Homes: Historic Infrastructure

    The homes surrounding Sonoma Plaza are among the oldest in wine country.
    If you need to install a water heater in Sonoma's historic district, expect additional considerations:

    - **Undersized gas lines** that were adequate for 1920s appliances but struggle with modern water heaters
    - **Outdated venting** that doesn't meet current code for efficient units
    - **Tight utility spaces** that limit equipment options
    - **No expansion tank** (now required on closed-loop systems)

    We work in historic Sonoma regularly and know how to navigate these challenges while respecting the home's character.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### The Springs: Multi-Unit Considerations

    Boyes Hot Springs, Fetters Hot Springs, and Agua Caliente have denser housing than other parts of Sonoma.
    Water heater service in The Springs often involves:

    - **Shared gas infrastructure** in multi-unit buildings
    - **Undersized water heaters** struggling to serve multiple units
    - **Deferred maintenance** in some rental properties
    - **Access challenges** in tight utility closets

    Whether you're a homeowner, landlord, or property manager, we can help you understand your options.

    ## Water Heater Install Defects We Often Find in Sonoma

    Not every water heater was installed correctly. When we repair or install water heaters in Sonoma, we regularly find:

    - **[Missing cold water shutoff valve](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-hot-cold/)** — Every water heater should have one
    - **[T&P valve plugged or capped](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-tnp/)** — Extremely dangerous; the valve prevents explosions
    - **[No expansion tank](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-expansion-tank/)** — Required on closed-loop systems
    - **[Improper venting](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-burner-flue/)** — Can put carbon monoxide in your home
    - **[Missing drip leg on gas line](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-gas-line/)** — Protects your burner from debris
    - **[No seismic strapping](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-extra-bits/)** — California code requires earthquake straps

    These aren't cosmetic issues—they're safety and code violations. Our installations include all required components.
