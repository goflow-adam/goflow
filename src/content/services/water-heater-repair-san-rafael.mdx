faqs:
  - question: How long do water heaters last in San Rafael's climate?
    answer: >-
      In Marin County's coastal climate, tank water heaters typically last 8-12
      years with proper maintenance. Tankless units can last 15-20 years.
      Regular maintenance can extend these lifespans significantly.
  - question: Do you offer same-day water heater repair in San Rafael?
    answer: >-
      Yes! We prioritize emergency repairs and offer same-day full service in
      most cases. Our technicians are available 24/7 for urgent issues.
  - question: Should I repair or replace my water heater?
    answer: >-
      If your unit is over 10 years old or repairs would cost more than 50% of a
      new unit, we typically recommend replacement. We'll help you evaluate the
      most cost-effective solution for your situation.
  - question: What areas of San Rafael do you serve?
    answer: >-
      We serve all San Rafael neighborhoods including Terra Linda, Peacock Gap,

    ## Your water heater problem just became ours.
    That cold shower, the leak spreading across your garage floor, the error code you can't decipher—
    we're already mentally rolling up our sleeves. Let's get this fixed.

    ## Your home isn’t a job site — it’s your home. We act like it.

    Our clothes are clean. Our shoes are clean—nevertheless they get covered.
    Your floors will get covered.
    And after all is said and done, we clean the area such that it is tough to tell we were ever there,
    except for the repaired or new water heater.

    **Let's get your water heater back on track.<br />[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350).**
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## First Things First
    1. Water on the floor? The [shutoff valve](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-hot-cold/#the-cold-water-intake) is on top of the tank—turn it clockwise.
    2. Gas odor? Leave the house immediately. Call PG&E from outside.
    3. If the tank body is cracked, don't use any hot water—pressure makes it worse.

    We know San Rafael's hills and traffic. We'll get to you as fast as safely possible.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## We are proud that San Rafael homeowners keep calling us

    They know our water heater services put their priorities first:
    How often do you need hot water? How quickly do you want it at the tap?
    How much do you use at peak times? Then we balance all of that with a price that works for you.

    **We grew up here.** Three generations of our family have been working in Marin County.
    We know the hillside drainage quirks in Dominican, the corrosion issues near the bay,
    and why Terra Linda homes have different needs than downtown properties.

    **We understand San Rafael's challenges.** Coastal air accelerates corrosion. Hillside
    locations create pressure variations. Older homes have undersized gas lines. We factor
    all of this into every recommendation.

    **No surprises on the bill.** The quote we give is the price you pay. Period.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's get this done right.**

    ## Water Heaters That Handle San Rafael's Climate

    Coastal air and hillside pressure variations affect which systems perform best here.
    Our recommendations are based on what we've seen work—and fail—in San Rafael homes:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tank Systems
    Reliable and budget-friendly. Gas, electric, or hybrid in 30-80 gallon sizes.
    **San Rafael consideration:** Coastal air accelerates anode rod corrosion. We recommend
    annual inspections to catch this before it becomes tank failure. Properly maintained,
    expect 8-12 years. We size based on your actual usage, not guesswork.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tankless Units
    Continuous hot water, compact footprint. Particularly good for San Rafael's hillside homes
    where water pressure fluctuates—tankless units handle pressure variations better than tanks.
    20+ year lifespan, 30% savings, maximum energy efficiency.
    Gas line and venting upgrades included in our install.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Heat Pump Water Heaters
    2-3x more efficient than standard tanks. San Rafael's humid, mild climate is actually
    ideal for heat pumps—they perform better here than in drier inland areas.
    They also dehumidify your garage, which many San Rafael homeowners appreciate.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Comparing Your Options

    | System | Upfront | Energy Savings | Lifespan | Best For |
    |--------|---------|----------------|----------|----------|
    | Tank | $ | Moderate | 8-12 yrs | Predictable usage |
    | Tankless | $$$ | High (30%) | 20+ yrs | High demand, small spaces |
    | Heat Pump | $$$ | Very High | 10-15 yrs | Efficiency-focused |
    | Solar | $$$$ | Maximum | 20+ yrs | Maximum savings |

    ## Costs and Savings in San Rafael
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Annual Energy Costs
    - Tank: $300-500
    - Tankless: $200-350
    - Heat pump: $150-300
    - Solar: $100-200

    Bay-adjacent homes in Peacock Gap and Loch Lomond may see shorter tank lifespans
    due to coastal air corrosion. Annual anode rod checks are worth the investment.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Marin County Rebates
    - **[MCE Clean Energy rebates](https://mcecleanenergy.org/explore-programs-and-offers/)** — San Rafael's default electricity provider offers heat pump incentives
    - **[Federal tax credits](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/energy-efficient-home-improvement-credit)** — Up to $2,000 per year for qualifying heat pump water heaters
    - **[TECH Clean California](https://techcleanca.com/incentives/single-family-incentives/)** — State incentives for heat pump water heaters
    - **[Switch Is On incentive finder](https://incentives.switchison.org/residents/incentives)** — Find all available rebates for your situation

    ## Water Heaters in San Rafael's Distinct Neighborhoods

    San Rafael's terrain—from bay-level properties to hillside homes—creates unique situations:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Hillside Homes
    Dominican, San Rafael Hill, the hills above Terra Linda—pressure variations affect 
    water heater performance up here. We size and configure systems to handle the fluctuations.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bay-Adjacent Properties
    Peacock Gap, Loch Lomond, the Canal—coastal air accelerates corrosion. Anode rods 
    wear out faster here. We recommend annual inspections to catch problems early.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Historic Downtown & Gerstle Park
    Some of the oldest homes in Marin. Gas lines sized for 1920s appliances, 
    tight utility spaces, infrastructure that needs upgrading for modern units.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Terra Linda
    Mid-century planned community with 1950s-60s infrastructure. Those original water heaters?
    Long gone. But the gas lines and venting may need updating for today's efficient units.
  </div>

  <div class="one-column">
    ## 11 PM on a Sunday? We Answer.

    Water heaters fail at the worst times. Cold shower before a Monday meeting?
    Leak spreading across the garage at midnight? We've handled both—and worse.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) any hour. We mean it.**
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Responsible Disposal
    When we remove your old water heater, it gets recycled or disposed of according to
    Marin County environmental regulations. We don't cut corners—proper disposal matters
    for our shared community.

    - **Tank corrosion** — Especially in Peacock Gap and Loch Lomond
