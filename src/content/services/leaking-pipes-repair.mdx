### A pipe leak is a home-protection problem.

Sometimes you see the drip.
Sometimes you see the stain and smell the damp first.
Either way, the goal is the same: stop the leak, protect the surrounding materials, and make sure it doesn’t come back.

We use non-invasive detection methods when needed, then repair the pipe the right way—cleanly and to code.
</div>

<div class="two-column">
## What to Do Right Now

- If water is actively leaking, shut off water to the fixture or shut off the home main.
- Move valuables out of the wet area and start drying (fans help).
- If the leak is near electrical outlets, keep the area dry and avoid using those circuits.

If it’s urgent, call: [707-200-8350](tel:7072008350)
