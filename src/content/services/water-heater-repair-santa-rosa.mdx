    ## Your home is our home (at least we will treat it that way)

    When we arrive, the drop cloths go down and the shoe covers go on.
    You won't see a trace we were there except for the working water heater.
    Even Matlock couldn't crack the case of the brand new water heater.

    We'll walk you through what we find and what your options are. No jargon, no pressure.
    Sonoma County permits? We handle the paperwork and schedule the inspection.

    **Ready? [Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's get this handled.**

    ## Santa Rosa homeowners call us because Santa Rosa is our home

    **Its not really your water heater we will fix, but the flow of your life.**
    Thats the real problem we want to fix. Lets fix that water heater so you can get back into your flow.

    **We've watched this city evolve.** Three generations of our family have worked here.
    Through the fires and the rebuilds. We've adapted as the infrastructure changed,
    and we understand things other plumbers miss—like why a Fountaingrove rebuild might have
    different needs than a Bennett Valley original.

    **We know every neighborhood.** The older systems in Railroad Square. The mid-century
    installations in Roseland. The brand-new units in Coffey Park.
    Each requires our same "your problem is our problem" approach, but in different contexts.

    **Honest pricing, always.** The number we quote is the number you pay. No surprise line items.
    We highly recommend calling us before a small issue becomes an emergency.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's get your hot water working.**

    ## Pick Yours: Which Water Heater is the one for Your Santa Rosa Home?

    From 1900s Victorians to 2020s rebuilds, Santa Rosa has it all.
    Here's what works based on our decades of local experience:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Classic Hot Water Heater Tanks
    The tried-and-true option: gas, electric, or hybrid in 30-80 gallon sizes.
    **Why one will work in your Santa Rosa home:** You already have the space, and the city's
    water quality is gentler on tanks than some neighboring areas. Annual flushing as part of water heater maintenance will
    keep yours running for 8-12 years.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tankless (Continuous Flow)
    Endless hot water from a wall-mounted energy-efficient water heater.
    There is a model and a configuration to add energy efficiency to your home.
    If you have a larger family that needs long bursts of hot water in the morning
    or if you are a smaller family or empty nesters, the on-demand nature of a tankless water heater
    saves you energy.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Heat Pump Water Heaters
    2-3x more efficient by pulling heat from ambient air. Santa Rosa's mild climate
    is ideal—these units struggle below 40°F, but we rarely see those temperatures.
    Popular with efficiency-minded homeowners. Bonus: they dehumidify your space.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Comparing Your Options

    | System | Upfront | Energy Savings | Lifespan | Best For |
    |--------|---------|----------------|----------|----------|
    | Tank | $ | Moderate | 8-12 yrs | Predictable usage |
    | Tankless | $$$ | High (30%) | 20+ yrs | High demand, limited space |
    | Heat Pump | $$$ | Very High | 10-15 yrs | Efficiency-focused |
    | Solar | $$$$ | Maximum | 20+ yrs | Maximum long-term savings |

    ## What We Repair and Replace in Santa Rosa
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Repairs We See Most in Santa Rosa
    - **New-to-old infrastructure issues** — Fire rebuild homes connecting to older city lines
    - **No hot water diagnosis** — We find the cause, not just the symptom
    - **Leak detection** — Tank, fittings, or relief valve
    - **Sediment flush** — Important for older Bennett Valley and Roseland systems
    - **Pilot light issues** — Common in Railroad Square's older gas infrastructure
    - **Strange noises** — Rumbling usually means sediment buildup which means energy loss and shorter life.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Water Heater Replacement & Installation
    - **Fire rebuild specialists** — We understand Fountaingrove and Coffey Park's modern systems
    - **Historic home experts** — Railroad Square and McDonald Avenue need careful approaches
    - All types: tank, tankless, heat pump, solar
    - Gas line upgrades for older infrastructure
    - Sonoma County permits handled
    - Same-day emergency replacement
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## While You're Waiting for Us
    1. **You've called [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—we're on our way.
    2. Leaking? The shutoff valve is on top of the tank. Turn it clockwise to stop the water.
    3. Smell gas? Get everyone outside and call PG&E before doing anything else.
    4. Tank cracked? Avoid running any hot water—it increases pressure and makes things worse.

    Santa Rosa is a big city, but we know the shortcuts. We'll be there soon.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## 3 AM and No Hot Water? We Answer.

    Water heaters fail at the worst times. Cold shower before work? Leak spreading 
    across the garage on a Sunday? We've handled both—and worse.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) any hour. That's what we're here for.**

    ## Santa Rosa's Unique Water Heater Challenges

    Santa Rosa has the most diverse housing stock in Sonoma County—each era brings different challenges:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Fire-Affected Areas
    Fountaingrove, Coffey Park, Mark West Springs—the 2017 fires changed everything.
    Brand-new homes with modern systems, but sometimes connecting to older city infrastructure.
    We understand where these systems meet and what that means for your water heater.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Historic Neighborhoods
    Railroad Square, McDonald Avenue—some of the oldest homes in Sonoma County.
    Gas lines sized for a different era, tight utility spaces, infrastructure that 
    may need upgrading for modern efficient units.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bennett Valley & the Hills
    Mid-century homes with systems that have been running for decades. Those original
    water heaters are long gone, but the gas lines and venting may need updating.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Roseland & Established Areas
    Working-class neighborhoods with aging infrastructure. We've been working these 
    areas for three generations and know what each situation needs.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## Installation Defects That Need Our Attention

    Not every water heater was installed correctly.
    Over the years, we've seen shortcuts and missing components that create safety hazards or reduce efficiency.
    Take a look at your water heater and call us if you notice any of these issues:

    - **[Missing cold water shutoff valve](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-hot-cold/)** — Every water heater should have one. Without it, you can't isolate the unit for repairs or emergencies.
    - **[T&P valve plugged or capped](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-tnp/)** — Previous owners sometimes plug the temperature and pressure relief valve to stop a drip.
    This is extremely dangerous—the valve prevents tank explosions.
    - **[No expansion tank](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-extra-bits/)** — Required on closed-loop systems to prevent pressure buildup.
    - **[Improper venting](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-burner-flue/)** — Gas water heaters need proper exhaust venting. Backdrafting can put carbon monoxide in your home.
    - **[Missing drip leg on gas line](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-gas-line/)** — This sediment trap protects your burner from debris.
    - **[No seismic strapping](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-extra-bits/)** — California code requires earthquake straps to prevent the tank from tipping.

    These aren't cosmetic issues—they're safety and code violations.
    Our repair services include correcting these defects so your water heater operates safely and meets current standards.

    ## What Goes Wrong in Santa Rosa Homes

    - **Sediment buildup** — Affects older systems more than newer ones
    - **Insufficient capacity** — Growing families outpacing original water heater sizing
