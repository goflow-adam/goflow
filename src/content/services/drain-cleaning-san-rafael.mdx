## Do’s & Don’ts for Healthy Drains

### Do:
- Use strainers in sinks and shower drains
- Run hot water after using the kitchen sink drain
- Schedule annual professional drain inspections
- Dispose of small food scraps in the trash—not the drain

### Don’t:
- Pour grease or oil down the drain
- Flush “flushable” wipes (they’re not really flushable)
- Use chemical drain cleaners (they can erode your pipes)
