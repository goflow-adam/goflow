    ### 1. Style and Finish
    Faucets come in a variety of finishes such as chrome, brushed nickel,

    countertop, or cabinet hardware to create a cohesive look.

    Choose a faucet that suits your sink's configuration. Deck-mounted
    faucets are common on sinks and countertops, while wall-mounted
    faucets are ideal for vessel sinks or modern designs.
