    ## Your plumbing emergency just became ours.

    Water's spraying. The toilet's overflowing. Something's making a sound that definitely isn't normal.
    Whatever's happening, we are locked in and ready to roll. Make your emergency ours.

    We're local to you. We handle emergencies the way we'd want someone to handle ours—
    show up quickly, stop the damage, explain what's happening, and make the repair without drama.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350 now](tel:7072008350)** — we answer 24 hours a day, every day.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## While You Wait for Us

    Before we arrive, here's how to minimize damage:

    - **Water spraying or flooding?** Shut off the nearest valve or the home's main shutoff.
    - **Sewer backup?** Stop running water and flushing toilets immediately.
    - **Smell gas?** Leave the house and call your gas utility from outside.
    - **Water near electrical?** Stay clear and don't touch anything wet.
    - **Move valuables** away from the affected area if you can do so safely.

    Not sure if it qualifies as a true emergency? Call anyway—we'll help you assess the risk.

    ## The Plumbing Emergencies We Handle
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### The 2 AM Calls

    These situations can't wait until morning. They need immediate response:

    - **Burst pipes** — Water spraying, flooding, or pooling. Shut off the main and call us.
    - **Major leaks** — Active leaks causing damage or that can't be contained.
    - **Sewer backups** — Sewage coming up through drains or toilets. Stop using water.
    - **Water main breaks** — No water to the house or water flooding the yard.
    - **Gas leaks** — If you smell gas, leave immediately and call the gas company first, then us.
    - **Flooding** — From any source. The priority is stopping the water and protecting your home.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** — we'll be there as fast as safely possible.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Urgent But Maybe Not 2 AM Urgent

    These situations are urgent and we'll prioritize them, but they may not require a middle-of-the-night response:

    - **No hot water** — Uncomfortable but usually not causing damage. We can often come same-day.
    - **Blocked toilet** — If you have another bathroom, it can wait until morning.
    - **Slow drains** — Annoying but not usually critical unless multiple drains are backing up.
    - **Dripping faucet** — Not an emergency, but we'll schedule you quickly.

    If you're not sure, call us. We'll tell you honestly whether it needs immediate attention
    or can wait for a regular appointment (which will cost you less).

    ## How Our Emergency Response Plumbing Works
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### When You Call

    1. **We answer** — A real person, not a call center. Available 24 hours.
    2. **We assess** — We'll ask questions to understand the situation and urgency.
    3. **We advise** — If there's something you can do to minimize damage, we'll tell you.
    4. **We dispatch** — If it's a true emergency, we're on our way.
    5. **We give you an ETA** — So you know when to expect us.

    We don't play games with "emergency fees" that triple the price.
    Our after-hours rate is higher than daytime, but it's fair and we tell you upfront.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### When We Arrive

    1. **We assess the damage** — What's happening, what caused it, what's at risk.
    2. **We stop the immediate problem** — Shutting off water, containing the leak, preventing further damage.
    3. **We explain your options** — What needs to happen now vs. what can wait.
    4. **We give you pricing** — Before we start any repairs.
    5. **We make the repair** — Cleanly, correctly, with respect for your home.
    6. **We verify it's fixed** — Testing, checking, making sure the crisis is actually over.

    No surprises. No pressure. Just competent help when you're stressed.

    ## What Emergency Plumbing Repair Costs

    Emergency plumbing services cost more than scheduled work. That's reality.
    But we don't use emergencies as an excuse to gouge you.

    **What affects pricing:**
    - **Time of call** — After-hours, weekends, and holidays have higher rates
    - **Severity** — A burst pipe flooding your house requires more urgency than a blocked toilet
    - **Repair complexity** — Some fixes are quick; some require parts or extensive work
    - **Access** — Can we get to the problem easily, or is it buried in a wall?

    **What we promise:**
    - Upfront pricing before we start any repair work
    - No "emergency multipliers" that triple the normal rate
    - Honest assessment of what's truly urgent vs. what can wait
    - If it can wait until morning and save you money, we'll tell you

  <div class="two-column">
    ## After the Crisis

    Once the immediate problem is handled, we don't just disappear.

    **Follow-up includes:**
    - **Documentation** — What we found, what we did, what you should watch for
    - **Insurance help** — Photos and documentation if you need to file a claim
    - **Prevention advice** — How to reduce the chance of this happening again
    - **Scheduling** — If additional work is needed, we'll get you on the calendar

    Some emergencies reveal bigger problems. We'll tell you honestly what we found
    and what it means for your plumbing system long-term.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## Preventing Future Emergencies

    Most plumbing emergencies are preventable. Here's what helps:

    **Know your shutoffs:**
    - Main water shutoff location (test it annually—they can seize up)
    - Individual fixture shutoffs (under sinks, behind toilets)
    - Water heater shutoff

    **Maintenance that prevents problems:**
    - Annual water heater inspection
    - Drain cleaning if you have recurring slow drains
    - Replacing old supply lines (especially braided steel hoses)
    - Addressing small leaks before they become big ones

    **Warning signs to watch:**
    - Water stains on ceilings or walls
    - Unexplained increases in water bill
    - Sounds of running water when nothing is on
    - Musty smells (hidden leaks)
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">

    ## Frequently Asked Questions
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### How fast can you respond?

    It depends on where you are and what we're currently handling.
    For true emergencies, we prioritize and get there as fast as safely possible.
    We'll give you an honest ETA when you call.

    ### What do repairs cost when it's urgent?

    More than scheduled service, but we don't gouge.
    After-hours rates are higher, and the repair itself depends on what's needed.
    We give you pricing before we start any work.

    ### Is my situation really an emergency?

    If water is actively causing damage or there's a safety risk (gas leak, sewage),
    it's an emergency. If it's inconvenient but not causing damage, it might be able to wait.
    Call us—we'll tell you honestly.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Should I try to fix it myself first?

    Shutting off water to stop flooding? Yes. Attempting repairs? Usually no.
    DIY repairs in a crisis often make things worse or create safety hazards.
    Focus on stopping the damage and call us.

    ### Do you charge extra for nights and weekends?

    Yes, after-hours rates are higher than daytime rates. That's standard.
    But we don't use "emergency multipliers" that triple the price.
    We'll tell you the rate when you call.

    ### What if it turns out to not be urgent?

    If we come out and it's not as serious as it seemed, we'll still help you.
    We might recommend scheduling a follow-up at regular rates instead of doing
    a full repair at after-hours pricing. We're not going to punish you for calling.
