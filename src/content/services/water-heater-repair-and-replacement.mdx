</div>
<div class="two-column">

  If your water heater is acting up like my 7-year-old, here's what to do while you wait for us:

  - **Active leaking?** Shut off the cold water supply valve on top of the heater.

  ### The Hot Water Tank Repair Jobs We Do Every Week

  Most water heaters repair jobs come down to a handful of common failures.
  Our trucks are always stocked with these so we can get your fix done in a jiffy like Jiffy Pop on the stove.

  - **Thermocouple replacement** — The #1 reason [pilot lights](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-light-pilot/) won't stay lit.
  - **[Gas valve](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-gas-valve/) replacement** — When the thermocouple isn't the problem, the gas valve often is.
  - **[Heating element](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-heating-element/) replacement** — Electric water heaters. Upper element, lower element, sometimes both.
  - **[Thermostat](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-thermostat/) replacement** — When temperature swings wildly or won't reach the set point.
  - **[Anode rod](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-anode-rod/) replacement** — The sacrificial rod that protects your tank. Should be checked annually.
  - **[Dip tube](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-dip-tube/) replacement** — When you get lukewarm water even with a full tank.
  - **[T&P valve](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-relief-valve/) replacement** — The safety valve that may leak or fail to operate.

  **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** or see [24/7 emergency plumbing](/emergency-plumbing-services/) for urgent situations.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Maintenance That Prevents Repairs

  - **[Sediment flush](/articles/anatomy-of-a-water-heater-sediment/)** — Removes buildup that reduces efficiency and shortens tank life.
  - **Descaling** — Essential for tankless units, especially with hard water.
  - **Combustion check** — Verifies gas units are burning clean and venting properly.

  A $150 maintenance visit can prevent a $1,500 replacement.
  We'll tell you honestly what your water heater needs—and what it doesn't.

  ## Hot Water System Repair and Installation
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Hot Water Tank Repair Service (Gas & Electric)

  Traditional water heaters are the workhorses of most homes. We handle hot water heater repair and replacement for all major brands.

  **Common issues we fix:**
  - No hot water or inconsistent temperature
  - Temperature swings mid-shower
  - Pilot or ignition failures
  - Pressure relief valve problems
  - Thermostat and heating element failures
  - Leaks at fittings, valves, and connections
  - Sediment buildup reducing performance
  - Strange noises (popping, rumbling, whining)

  **Brands we install:** Rheem, Bradford White, A.O. Smith, State, and others.
  We'll help you choose based on your priorities—not ours.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Tankless Hot Water Repair & Installation

  Tankless water heaters offer endless hot water and better energy efficiency—when they're working right.

  **Common tankless issues:**
  - Error codes and intermittent shutdowns
  - Flow and temperature inconsistency
  - Mineral scaling (descaling service)
  - Ignition and venting problems
  - Component failures

  **Thinking about going tankless?**
  We'll tell you honestly what upgrades are required (gas line sizing, venting, electrical)
  before you commit. Sometimes it makes sense. Sometimes a high-efficiency tank is the better call.

  **Brands we install:** Navien, Rinnai, Noritz, Rheem.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Electric Hot Water Tank Repair and Heat Pumps

  We handle all electric hot water tank repair, including heat pump water heaters.
  Heat pumps offer the best energy efficiency—2-3x more efficient than standard electric.
  They pull heat from the air instead of generating it directly.

  **Good fit if:**
  - You have space (they need airflow)
  - Your water heater is in a garage, basement, or utility room
  - You want to reduce energy bills significantly
  - You're eligible for rebates (often $500-$1,000+)

  **Not ideal if:**
  - Your water heater is in a tight closet
  - You need the fastest recovery time
  - Upfront cost is the primary concern
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Solar Water Heaters

  We service and install solar water heating systems.
  In the North Bay's climate, solar can provide 50-80% of your hot water needs.

  Solar systems require more maintenance than conventional heaters,
  but the energy savings can be substantial over time.

  ## How We Run a Hot Water Repair Service Call
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Our Process

  1. **We ask questions first** — So we arrive with the right parts and tools.
  2. **We inspect and test** — Pinpointing the actual failure, not guessing.
  3. **We explain what we found** — In plain language, not plumber-speak.
  4. **We give you options and pricing** — Before we do any work.
  5. **We do the repair cleanly** — Drop cloths, shoe covers, respect for your home.
  6. **We test before we leave** — Verifying the fix actually worked.

  No surprises. No upselling. Just honest diagnosis and quality repair.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Safety Checks Included

  Every water heater service call includes:

  - **Gas leak testing** — Verifying all connections are safe
  - **CO testing** (gas units) — Checking combustion and venting
  - **T&P valve check** — Ensuring the safety valve operates
  - **Seismic strap inspection** — California requires them; we check them

  These aren't upsells. They're part of doing the job right.

  ## Repair vs. Replace: When Each Makes Sense
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### We'll Repair When It's Smart

  A thermocouple on a 5-year-old unit? Easy repair.
  A leaking fitting on an otherwise healthy tank? Worth fixing.

  **Repair usually makes sense when:**
  - The unit is under 8 years old
  - The repair cost is under 50% of replacement
  - The leak is at fittings or valves (not the tank body)
  - It's the first major issue
  - The unit still performs well otherwise
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Water Heater Replacement Only When Prudent

  We don't push water heater replacements. But we'll tell you when a repair is throwing good money after bad.

  **Replacement usually makes sense when:**
  - The tank itself is leaking (that's not repairable)
  - The unit is 10-12+ years old
  - You've had multiple repairs recently
  - Corrosion or water damage makes repair unreliable
  - Efficiency is so poor you're paying for it monthly

</div>

<div class="two-column">
  ## What Affects Pricing

  We give upfront pricing before any work begins. Here's what affects the quote:

  - **Type of repair** — Thermocouple vs. gas valve vs. full replacement
  - **System type** — Tank repairs are usually simpler than tankless
  - **Access** — Tight closets take longer than open garages
  - **Code upgrades** — Older installations may need updates (expansion tank, proper venting)
  - **Permits** — Required for new installations and some replacements

  **Typical timeframes:**
  - Simple repair: 30 minutes to 2 hours
  - Tank replacement: 2-4 hours
  - Tankless installation: 4-8 hours (more if upgrades needed)
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ## Warranties

  **Manufacturer warranty:** Most tanks carry 6-12 year warranties. Tankless units often 10-15 years.
  Professional installation is usually required to keep the warranty valid.

  **Our labor warranty:** We stand behind our work. If something we installed or repaired fails,
  we'll make it right.

  **What voids warranties:** DIY modifications, lack of maintenance, improper installation.
  We document everything so your warranty stays protected.
</div>

  ## Frequently Asked Questions
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### How long do water heaters last?

  Tank water heaters typically last 8-12 years. Tankless units can last 15-20 years with proper maintenance.
  Hard water, lack of maintenance, and heavy use all shorten lifespan.

  ### Should I repair or replace my water heater?

  Generally: if it's under 8 years old and the repair is under 50% of replacement cost, repair makes sense.
  If the tank itself is leaking, replacement is the only option—tank leaks can't be repaired.

  ### What's the difference between tank and tankless?

  Traditional water heaters store 40-80 gallons of hot water, ready when you need it.
  Tankless water heaters heat on demand—endless hot water, but higher upfront cost.
  We can help you decide which of these types of water heaters fits your household.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### How do I know what size water heater I need?

  For tanks: 40 gallons for 1-2 people, 50 gallons for 2-3, 80 gallons for 4+.
  For tankless: sizing is based on flow rate and temperature rise. We'll calculate it for you.

  ### What maintenance does a water heater need?

  Annual sediment flush, anode rod inspection every 2-3 years, and T&P valve testing.
  Tankless units need descaling every 1-2 years, especially with hard water.

  ### How long does water heater installation take?

  Tank replacement: 2-4 hours. Tankless installation: 4-8 hours, longer if gas line or electrical upgrades are needed.
