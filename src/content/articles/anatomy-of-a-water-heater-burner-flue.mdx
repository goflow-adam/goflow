    At the heart of your water heater is the **burner**, and above it is the **flue** —
    two parts that work together to heat your water safely and efficiently.
    While they’re usually hidden from view, understanding how they work (and what to look for)
    can help you spot early warning signs before small issues become dangerous ones.

    ## The Burner: Where the Heat Begins

    The burner sits beneath your water heater’s tank and is responsible for producing
    the flame that heats the water inside. When your thermostat calls for heat,
    gas flows to the burner and ignites, creating a steady, controlled flame.

    That flame heats the bottom of the tank, warming the water inside until it reaches the desired temperature.
    Once that happens, the burner shuts off and waits until more hot water is needed.

    A healthy burner flame should burn **clean and steady**, usually blue in color.
    Yellow or flickering flames can be a sign of improper combustion or airflow issues
    and should be checked by a professional.

    ## The Flue: Safely Carrying Exhaust Away

    As the burner heats the water, it also produces exhaust gases — including carbon monoxide —
    that must be safely vented out of your home. This is where the **flue** comes in.

    The flue is the rigid metal pipe that runs upward from the top of your water heater
    and carries exhaust gases safely outside. Hot gases naturally rise, allowing the system
    to vent without fans or motors in most traditional gas water heaters.

    ## What to Look For

    There are a few important things you can safely check visually:

    **• Proper Alignment**
    The draft hood (the metal cap on top of the water heater) should sit evenly
    and direct exhaust smoothly into the flue pipe. It should not be crooked, crushed, or disconnected.

    **• Secure, Rigid Venting**
    The flue pipe should be made of rigid metal and properly joined.
    Duct tape should **never** be used on the flue — if you see tape,
    it’s a sign that something may have been improperly repaired or modified.
    Flue connections should be secured with proper fasteners designed for high heat.

    **• No Soot or Discoloration**
    Soot, black residue, or corrosion around the burner, draft hood, or flue pipe is a warning sign.
    It may indicate incomplete combustion or poor venting, both of which can be dangerous.

    ## Why This Matters

    When the burner and flue are working together properly,
    exhaust gases leave your home safely and efficiently.
    If that process is disrupted — even slightly —
    harmful gases can spill back into your living space instead of exiting through the vent.

    This is why proper alignment, clean surfaces, and solid connections matter so much.
    These components aren’t just about performance — they’re about safety.

    ## When to Call Us

    Please [call us](tel:7072008350) if you notice:

    * Loose or disconnected flue piping
    * Any use of duct tape on the vent
    * Soot, corrosion, or rust flakes
    * A strong smell near the heater
    * Unusual flame color or flickering

    These issues don’t always mean something is failing —
    but they *do* mean it’s time for a trained eye to take a look.

    ##  Quietly Protecting Your Home

    When your burner and flue are working properly, you never have to think about them —
    and that’s exactly how it should be. They quietly do their job, keeping your water hot and your home safe.

    If something doesn’t look quite right, trust that instinct.
    Catching small issues early is one of the best ways to avoid bigger problems later.
