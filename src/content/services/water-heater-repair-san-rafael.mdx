    **Your water heater problem just became ours.**<br />
    That cold shower, the leak spreading across your garage floor, the error code you can't decipher—
    we're already mentally rolling up our sleeves. [Call us now at (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)
    and let us get your hot water back with a solution built to last.

    San Rafael's terrain creates unique water heater challenges. Hillside homes in Dominican
    deal with pressure variations. Bay-adjacent properties in Peacock Gap face corrosion from
    coastal air. We've worked on water heaters across every San Rafael neighborhood and know
    what each environment demands.

    ## First Things First
    1. **Call [(707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)**—we'll confirm when we can be there.
    2. Water on the floor? The shutoff valve is on top of the tank—turn it clockwise.
    3. Gas odor? Leave the house immediately. Call PG&E from outside.
    4. If the tank body is cracked, don't use any hot water—pressure makes it worse.

    We know San Rafael's hills and traffic. We'll get to you as fast as safely possible.

    ## How We Work in San Rafael Homes

    Your floors get drop cloths. Your entryway gets shoe covers. Your home gets treated
    like it belongs to someone we care about—because that's how we would want our own home treated.

    San Rafael's terrain creates unique situations. Hillside homes in Dominican have pressure
    variations that affect water heater performance. Bay-adjacent properties in Peacock Gap
    deal with salt air corrosion. Downtown Victorians have gas lines sized for 1920s appliances.
    We've worked in all these environments and know what each demands.

    Permits and inspections? We handle the city paperwork so you don't have to navigate it.

    ## Water Heaters That Handle San Rafael's Climate

    Coastal air and hillside pressure variations affect which systems perform best here.
    Our recommendations are based on what we've seen work—and fail—in San Rafael homes:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tank Systems
    Reliable and budget-friendly. Gas, electric, or hybrid in 30-80 gallon sizes.
    **San Rafael consideration:** Coastal air accelerates anode rod corrosion. We recommend
    annual inspections to catch this before it becomes tank failure. Properly maintained,
    expect 8-12 years. We size based on your actual usage, not guesswork.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tankless Units
    Continuous hot water, compact footprint. Particularly good for San Rafael's hillside homes
    where water pressure fluctuates—tankless units handle pressure variations better than tanks.
    20+ year lifespan, 30% savings, maximum energy efficiency.
    Gas line and venting upgrades included in our install.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Heat Pump Water Heaters
    2-3x more efficient than standard tanks. San Rafael's humid, mild climate is actually
    ideal for heat pumps—they perform better here than in drier inland areas.
    They also dehumidify your garage, which many San Rafael homeowners appreciate.

  <div class="one-column">
    ## Comparing Your Options

    | System | Upfront | Energy Savings | Lifespan | Best For |
    |--------|---------|----------------|----------|----------|
    | Tank | $ | Moderate | 8-12 yrs | Predictable usage |
    | Tankless | $$$ | High (30%) | 20+ yrs | High demand, small spaces |
    | Heat Pump | $$$ | Very High | 10-15 yrs | Efficiency-focused |
    | Solar | $$$$ | Maximum | 20+ yrs | Maximum savings |
