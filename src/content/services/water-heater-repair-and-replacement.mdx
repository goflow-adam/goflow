  ### No hot water is more than an inconvenience.
  Your water heater is acting up. It's leaking, not heating, or acting unpredictably.
  It is messing with your home life and **we want to be the ones to put it right**.
  You need a water heater expert who can diagnose the cause and deliver the right-sized fix
  getting your hot water back.

  If your hot water heater won’t heat water to a stable water temperature,
  we’ll treat it like an urgent home problem—because it is.

  We only offer the water heater solutions we would offer our own moms.

  [Call now](tel:7072008350) and we’ll help you figure out what’s going on
  and what it will take to get hot water back.
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ## What to Do Right Now (Quick Homeowner Checklist)
  - If you see active leaking, shut off the cold supply to the heater.
  - If the tank is leaking from the body of the heater, stop using it—tank leaks typically get worse.
  - If you smell gas or suspect a dangerous condition, leave the area and call your gas utility.
  - If water is pooling near electrical components, avoid the area and call.

  [Call us](tel:7072008350) as soon as you are ready or see more here: [24/7 emergency plumbing](/emergency-plumbing-services/).

  ## What We Repair (Tank, Tankless, Gas, and Electric)
</div>
<div class="two-column">
  ### Traditional Tank Water Heater Repair and Installs
  Common issues we address:
  - No hot water / inconsistent temperature
  - Water temperature that swings from hot to lukewarm mid-shower
  - Pilot or ignition failures
  - Pressure relief valve concerns
  - Thermostat and heating element failures
  - Leaks at fittings, valves, and connections
  - Sediment buildup reducing performance
</div>
<div class="two-column">
### Tankless Water Heater Installation and Repair
Common issues we address:
- Error codes and intermittent shutdowns
- Flow/temperature inconsistency
- Mineral scaling and descaling needs
- Ignition and venting-related problems
- Component replacement when needed

If you’re evaluating tankless systems because you want better performance
and lower energy costs, we’ll help you understand what upgrades are actually
required (gas sizing, venting, electrical) before you commit.

<div class="two-column">
## How We Run a Water Heater Repair Call
We keep it simple:
- Ask a few questions so we arrive prepared
- Inspect, test, and pinpoint the failure (not guessing)
- Explain what we found in plain language
- Give you a clear price and the options
- Do the repair cleanly and test before we leave
</div>
<div class="two-column">
## Repair vs Replace (When Each One Makes Sense)
We’ll repair when it’s a safe, smart fix.
We’ll recommend replacement when the repair won’t hold up, won’t be cost-effective, or creates safety risk.

Replacement is more likely when:
- The tank is leaking from the body
- The unit is older and repeatedly failing
- Corrosion or damage makes repair unreliable
- Efficiency is so poor you’re paying for it every month

If rising energy bills are part of the problem,
we’ll talk through your options across the main types of water
heaters—including tankless systems and heat pumps
(like a heat pump water heater)—so you can reduce long-term energy costs.
