    ### Sewer problems can get ugly fast. Our job is to stop the damage and keep it clean.

    Let me tell you a little clogged sewer line story.
    I was 11 and standing in a San Francisco garage underneath a sewer line running across the garage ceiling.
    The plumber I was riding along with, Norm, was standing at the other end of the garage.
    He grabbed his hammer and hit that old 4" clogged up cast iron sewer pipe and it opened up all the way down on me.
    I was drenched in sewage and shards of cast iron.
    He laughed thinking he was teaching me a lesson of sorts, but it was morning and he had to ride around the city all day with me like that.
    That was my only consolation.

    Today, we rely on real diagnostics and proven methods, so we can fix the problem with as little disruption as possible.

    ## What to Do Right Now

    - If sewage is backing up, stop using water in the home (showers, laundry, toilets).
    - If you have only one bathroom and it’s backing up, call before it overflows.
    - Keep kids and pets away from any contaminated area.

    If it’s urgent, call: [707-200-8350](tel:7072008350)
