faqs:
  - question: "What are the first signs a drain clog is getting worse?"
    answer: "Slow draining, gurgling, odors, or water backing up in a different fixture than the one you used. If you notice multiple fixtures acting up, it can be a main line issue—call us before it becomes a backup."
  - question: "Can you clear drains without making a mess?"
    answer: "Yes. We protect the area, work clean, and clean up after. We'll also explain what we're doing before we do it—especially if we need to use a cleanout or camera."
  - question: "Do you offer camera inspection for recurring clogs?"
    answer: "Yes. When a clog keeps coming back, a camera inspection helps us find the real cause (buildup, roots, a belly in the line, or a damaged section) so we can recommend the right fix."
  - question: "Is hydro-jetting always necessary?"
    answer: "No. Sometimes a professional cable/snake is the right tool. Hydro-jetting is great for heavy buildup and restoring full pipe diameter, but we choose the method based on your pipe type and the problem we see."
  - question: "Do you provide emergency drain cleaning in Novato?"
    answer: "Yes. If you have an active backup or no-drain situation, call us and we'll give you a clear arrival window."

    ## Novato's Unique Drain Challenges

    Novato's history as a small town that grew into Marin's northernmost city means
    we encounter plumbing systems from every era.
    Here's what makes drain cleaning in Novato different:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Hamilton Field
    - Former military base with 1940s-era infrastructure converted to residential
    - Unique plumbing layouts from military housing design
    - Mix of original systems and modern retrofits
    - Specific drainage patterns from the original base layout
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Old Town Novato
    - Vintage cottages and bungalows with original drain systems
    - Heritage-conscious techniques for older pipes
    - Mature landscaping with aggressive root systems
    - Narrow lots with limited access points
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### San Marin & Ignacio Valley
    - 1970s-80s developments with specific soil challenges
    - Clay-heavy soil that stresses pipes and encourages settling
    - Mature trees planted during original development now causing root intrusion
    - Complex multi-level homes with gravity-dependent drainage
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Highway 37 Corridor & Newer Areas
    - Modern construction with contemporary materials
    - Larger homes with multiple bathrooms and complex layouts
    - Connection points between new construction and older city infrastructure
    - Rural properties with septic considerations
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    **Don't wait until that slow drain becomes a flooded bathroom.

    ## Novato Drain Problems We Handle

    From Hamilton to San Marin, we've cleared every type of clog Novato homes can produce:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Bathroom Backups
    - Toilets that won't budge with a plunger
    - Shower floors filling up while you're in them
    - Tubs that drain at a crawl
    - Sinks making gurgling protests
    - Multiple fixtures failing together
    - Soap scum and hair buildup
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Kitchen Disasters
    - Disposals that jam or won't drain
    - Sinks you can't use because they're full
    - Dishwasher water with nowhere to go
    - Clogs that keep returning
    - Grease buildup from years of cooking
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Utility & Laundry
    - Washing machine floods mid-cycle
    - Utility sinks that won't empty
    - Garage drains backing up
    - Sump and drainage problems
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Main Sewer Line
    - Whole-house backup symptoms
    - Sewer odors you can't explain
    - Those mature Novato oaks finding your pipes
    - Cracked, collapsed, or settling lines
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">
    ## The Way We Work
    Novato's mix of eras—military housing, vintage cottages, modern developments—means
    we can't use a one-size-fits-all drain cleaning solution:
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Figure Out What's Wrong
    We run diagnostics: water tests, fixture checks, listening to your system.
    Is this a single clog or something affecting the whole house? We determine that before touching anything.
    Cameras go in when we need to see what's happening deep in the line.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Tell You What We Found
    Before we start work, you'll know exactly what's going on and what it'll cost to fix.
    We explain the options in plain English. You decide what makes sense for your home and budget.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Clear the Blockage
    Cable machines for routine clogs. Hydro jetting for heavy buildup. Root cutters for those
    Novato oaks that find every pipe joint. We use what works and keep at it until the line runs clear.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Confirm and Prevent
    We verify flow is restored, then share practical tips to avoid future problems.
    If we spotted something concerning—early root intrusion, a settling pipe—we'll tell you.
    But we don't push unnecessary repairs.
  </div>
  <div class="one-column">

    ## Why Novato Keeps Calling Us Back

    Not for the same clog—we fix those permanently. They call us back because when something
    else goes wrong, they remember how we handled the last job.

    military base to family neighborhood. Watching Novato grow into Marin's largest city by area.
    We know this place because we've been part of it for decades.

    **We understand what makes Novato different.** The 1940s plumbing quirks at Hamilton.
    The clay soil challenges in Ignacio Valley. The mature oaks with roots that seek out pipe joints.
    We account for all of it.

    **What we quote is what you pay.** No creative billing. No invented problems.
    Just honest work at a fair price.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350) and let's solve this.**

    ### Habits That Help:
    - Strainers in every drain (simple and effective)
    - Cold water while the disposal runs
    - Yearly maintenance so pipes don't end up requiring repair service
    - Addressing slow drains before they stop completely
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Things That Cause Problems:
    - Grease down the drain (it hardens and catches debris)
    - Flushing wipes of any kind (they don't break down)
    - Chemical drain cleaners (they damage your pipes)
    - Waiting until a slow drain becomes a stopped drain
