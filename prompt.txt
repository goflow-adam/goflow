Can you please build out a web application using
the current configuration as the base of the application without switching to tailwindcss?

The site should:
1. Optimize our search engine rankings.
2. Use markdown files as content for each of the routes described below in the primary navigation items section.
3. Be designed to be responsive and mobile first.
4. Use the color palette provided in the color palette section.
5. Use the primary components provided in the primary components section.
6. Use all the navigation items provided in the primary navigation items section and use the corresponding path for the routing of each of those pages.
7. Include the sub pages of the primary navigation items as dropdown menus in both the mobile and non-mobile versions.
8. Include status indicator states on all menu items.
9. The domain goflow.plumbing for the application.
10. Use the json files at
/Users/doubletap/Documents/GoFlow/Website/SEO/SearchSchemaMarkup to help with the search engine optimization by including the markup in each corresponding route.

Color palette for the application:
#1f4a6f (primary, header and footer backgrounds)
#509cba (secondary, mobile drawer menu background)
#f4f7f5 (background, body background, navigation text color, button text color)
#ffc60c (accent, secondary button color)
#bd0006 (error, primary button color)
#000000 (black, primary text color)

Primary Components:
1. Header
2. Body
3. Footer
