### Stop waiting for hot water | get instant hot-diggity goodness

    It's the instant glow-up for your sink—coffee, tea, or oatmeal ready piping hot water at the push of a button.
    Push the button, see the steam, and you have your hot water in a jiffy.
    
    But maybe you already have had all that convenience and it has stopped working.
    You need that little hot button back, and as fast as it used to make that almost boiling water.
    
    We can't wait to install a new instant hot or repair or replace your old one with something more energy efficient but just as good.

    We have all your top-of-the-line brands like InSinkErator, Moen, Kohler, and others in stock and ready for your sink.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** and we'll get your instant hot water working.

    ## What to Do Right Now

    If your instant hot system isn't working:

    - **Not heating?** Don't keep cycling power—that can damage the unit. Call for diagnosis.
    - **Leaking under sink?** Shut off the water supply and dry out the cabinet.
    - **Smell burning or tripped breaker?** Stop using it and have the electrical checked.
    - **Water not as hot as before?** Could be thermostat, element, or scale buildup.

    Most instant hot dispenser repairs are straightforward once we diagnose the issue.

    ## How Instant Hot Dispensers Work
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### The System

    An instant hot water dispenser has two parts:

    - **The tank** — A small (about half-gallon) insulated tank that sits under your sink,
      keeping water at near-boiling temperature (around 190°F).
    - **The faucet** — A dedicated faucet mounted at your sink that dispenses the hot water.

    When you turn the faucet, you get instant near-boiling water. The tank refills and reheats
    automatically. Simple, convenient, and surprisingly useful once you have one.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Brands We Service

    - **InSinkErator** — The most common brand by far. We do InSinkErator instant hot repair regularly.
    - **Waste King** — Similar design, similar issues.
    - **Franke** — Higher-end units with more features.
    - **KitchenAid** — Often rebranded InSinkErator units.
    - **Kohler, Moen, others** — We service all major brands.

    Most instant hot dispensers work the same way regardless of brand.
    If yours isn't working, we can diagnose and fix it.

  <div class="two-column">
    ### Common Problems We Fix

    - **Not heating** — Heating element failure, thermostat issue, or electrical problem.
    - **Not hot enough** — Thermostat needs adjustment or element is failing.
    - **Leaking** — Tank corrosion, fitting failure, or faucet issue.
    - **Slow flow** — Scale buildup or filter clog.
    - **Tripping breaker** — Electrical issue or failing element drawing too much power.
    - **Strange taste** — Tank needs flushing or filter replacement.

    We diagnose the issue and tell you honestly whether repair or replacement makes sense.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Repair vs. Replace

    **Repair usually makes sense when:**
    - Unit is less than 5 years old
    - Simple fix (thermostat, faucet, fitting)
    - Tank is not corroded

    **Replacement usually makes sense when:**
    - Tank is leaking (internal corrosion)
    - Unit is 8+ years old and failing
    - Repair cost approaches replacement cost
    - You want to upgrade features

    Instant hot dispensers are relatively affordable ($150-400 for the unit),
    so replacement often makes more sense than expensive repairs on old units.

    ## Installation
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### New Instant Hot Dispenser Installation

    Adding an instant hot dispenser to your sink:

    **What's involved:**
    - Mounting the tank under the sink
    - Connecting to cold water supply
    - Installing the faucet (requires a hole in sink or countertop)
    - Electrical connection (dedicated outlet recommended)
    - Testing and adjusting temperature

    **Requirements:**
    - Space under sink for the tank (about the size of a small coffee maker)
    - Electrical outlet (or we can add one)
    - Hole for the faucet (existing soap dispenser hole often works)

    Most installations take 1-2 hours.
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Replacement

    Replacing an existing instant hot dispenser:

    **Same brand/model:**
    - Usually straightforward
    - Existing connections often work
    - 30-60 minutes typical

    **Different brand or upgrading:**
    - May need faucet replacement
    - Mounting may differ slightly
    - 1-2 hours typical

    We can supply the unit or install one you've purchased.
    We'll recommend brands based on your needs and budget.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## What Affects Pricing

    We give upfront pricing before any work begins. Here's what affects the quote:

    - **Repair vs. replace** — Repairs are generally less expensive.
    - **Type of repair** — Thermostat adjustment vs. element replacement vs. faucet repair.
    - **Unit cost** — If replacing, units range from $150-400 depending on brand and features.
    - **Electrical work** — If a new outlet is needed for installation.
    - **New vs. replacement** — New installations take longer than replacements.

    **Typical timeframes:**
    - Repair: 30-60 minutes
    - Replacement (same brand): 30-60 minutes
    - Replacement (different brand): 1-2 hours
    - New installation: 1-2 hours
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ## Maintenance Tips

    Keep your instant hot dispenser working longer:

    - **Flush annually** — Drain and refill the tank to remove sediment buildup.
    - **Check for leaks** — Look under the sink periodically for drips.
    - **Use it regularly** — Stagnant water can affect taste and tank life.
    - **Water quality matters** — Hard water areas see more scale buildup and shorter lifespans.
    - **Strange taste?** — Time for a flush or filter replacement.

    With basic maintenance, these units typically last 5-10 years.

    Typically 5-10 years depending on water quality and use.

    If the tank is leaking or the unit is 8+ years old, replacement usually makes more sense.
