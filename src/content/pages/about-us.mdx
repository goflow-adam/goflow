    ### Your plumbing problem becomes our problem to solve.

    That's not a tagline—it's how we actually operate. When you call GoFlow, you're getting
    a team that knows this area, knows plumbing, and genuinely cares about doing the job right.

    We're not a franchise. We're not a call center routing you to whoever's available.
    We're a local company built by plumbers who got tired of watching customers get treated
    like transactions instead of people.

    **[Call (707) 200-8350](tel:7072008350)** and see the difference.

    ## Three Generations of Plumbing

    GoFlow's roots go back to 1959. That's three generations of plumbing expertise—
    learning what works, what doesn't, and how to treat customers right.

    Our founders, **Chris Torres** and **Adam Bragg**, built GoFlow on a simple idea:
    customers deserve clarity, honesty, and protection. Both grew up around plumbing.
    Both learned the trade hands-on. And both saw too many companies prioritize sales over solutions.

    So they built something different.

    ## What We Believe
  </div>
  <div class="two-column">
    ### Treat every home like it's your mom's house

    This isn't a slogan—it's how we actually operate. Drop cloths go down. Shoe covers go on.
    We clean up after ourselves. We explain what we're doing and why. We don't leave until
    you're satisfied with the work.

    ### Fix what needs fixing—nothing more

    We'd rather do a $200 repair and have you call us again in five years than push a
    $2,000 replacement you didn't need. That's not good business strategy—it's just how
    we think plumbing should work.

  <div class="two-column">
    ### Give you a price before we start

    The number we quote is the number you pay. No surprise line items. No "well, we found
    something else" add-ons after the fact. If something changes, we explain it and get
    your approval before proceeding.

    ### Show up when we say we will

    If we say we'll be there at 10, we'll be there at 10. If something changes, we call.
    Your time matters. We don't treat it like it doesn't.

    ### Stand behind our work

    If something we fixed fails because of our work, we make it right. Period.

    ## Where We Work

    We serve all of [Sonoma County](/sonoma-county-plumbing/) and [Marin County](/marin-county-plumbing/)—
    from Santa Rosa to San Rafael, Petaluma to Novato, and everywhere in between.

    Three generations of working in these communities means we know the terrain, the building codes,
    the common issues, and the local inspectors. We're not learning on your dime.

    ### Delta Faucet Pro Certified

    [GoFlow is a **Delta Faucet Pro Certified** plumber](https://findapro.deltafaucet.com/contractors/goflow-plumbing-48855-sonoma-ca).
    This means we've completed Delta's professional training program and meet their standards for installation and service of Delta products.

    When you need a Delta faucet installed, repaired, or replaced,
    you're getting a team that knows these products inside and out—not someone figuring it out on the job.
