faqs:
  - question: Do you provide emergency plumbing in Santa Rosa?
    answer: >-
      Yes. If you have an active leak, no hot water, a sewer smell, or a drain
      backup that can’t wait, call us. We’ll give you a clear arrival window and
      get the situation under control with calm urgency.
  - question: Can you help with recurring clogs in Santa Rosa?
    answer: >-
      Yes. If clogs keep coming back, we treat it like a diagnosis—not just a

      camera inspection) so you’re not stuck repeating the same problem.
  - question: Do you repair and replace water heaters in Santa Rosa?
    answer: >-
      Yes. We repair and replace both tank and tankless water heaters. If a
      repair is worth it, we’ll do it. If replacement is the smarter move, we’ll
      explain why and size the system correctly for your home.
  - question: What should I do first if I find a leak in my home?
    answer: >-
      Shut off the nearest fixture valve (or your main water shutoff if needed),
      move valuables out of harm’s way, and call us. We’ll help you limit damage
      and get a plan in motion quickly.

  <div class="one-column">
    ## Plumbing in a City That Burned and Rebuilt
    
    The 2017 Tubbs Fire changed Santa Rosa. Over 3,000 homes were destroyed in Fountaingrove, Coffey Park, and the surrounding areas.
    In the years since, most have been rebuilt—but that rebuilding happened fast, under pressure, and with a construction workforce stretched thin.
    
    We've worked in dozens of these rebuilt homes. Most are fine. But we've also seen:
    
    - **Rushed connections** — Supply lines and drain fittings that weren't properly secured
    - **Undersized water heaters** — Builders installing the cheapest option rather than sizing for the home
    - **Missing or incorrect PRVs** — Pressure reducing valves that were skipped or set wrong
    - **Warranty work that wasn't done right** — Callbacks from the original builder that created new problems
    
    If you're in a fire rebuild area and something doesn't seem right, we can diagnose it. 
    We're not here to blame your builder—we're here to fix what needs fixing and make sure your plumbing actually works the way it should.
    
    And if your home *survived* the fires while your neighbors rebuilt, you're in a different situation: 
    older plumbing that's been through stress, possibly with new municipal connections or pressure changes from the rebuilt infrastructure around you.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## The Oldest Pipes in Sonoma County
    
    Santa Rosa's historic core—Downtown, Railroad Square, the West End, Cherry Street, McDonald Avenue—has some of the oldest plumbing in the region.
    We're talking homes built in the early 1900s, some even earlier.
    
    In these neighborhoods, we regularly find:
    - **Galvanized steel supply lines** corroding from the inside, restricting flow and eventually leaking
    - **Original cast iron drains** that have lasted 80-100 years but are now cracking, rusting through, or separating at joints
    - **Clay sewer laterals** with root intrusion from the mature trees that line these streets
    - **Outdated drain configurations** that don't meet modern code and cause recurring problems
    
    If you're in an older Santa Rosa neighborhood and you're dealing with low water pressure, rusty water, slow drains, or recurring clogs, 
    the age of your pipes is probably the root cause. We can camera-inspect your lines and give you an honest assessment of what's worth repairing versus replacing.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## Bennett Valley, Fountaingrove, and the Hills
    
    Santa Rosa's hillside neighborhoods have their own set of challenges. The terrain that gives you those views also creates plumbing complications.
    
    **Water pressure swings:** Homes at higher elevations often have lower pressure; homes at the bottom of hills can have pressure that's too high. 
    PRVs (pressure reducing valves) are common in these areas, and they wear out every 10-15 years. 
    If yours is original to the home, it's probably due for replacement.
    
    **Soil movement:** The clay-heavy soil in Bennett Valley expands when wet and contracts when dry. 
    Over decades, this shifting can stress underground pipes, creating bellies in sewer lines where debris collects and backups start.
    
    **Fire zone considerations:** Much of Fountaingrove is in a high fire risk zone. 
    If you're planning plumbing work, it's worth thinking about access for emergency vehicles and defensible space requirements.

  <div class="two-column">
    ## Russian River Water and Your Plumbing
    
    Santa Rosa's water comes from the <a href="https://www.srcity.org/852/Water-Supply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Santa Rosa</a>, 
    sourced from the Russian River via Sonoma Water. It's good water—naturally filtered through gravel beds, meets all safety standards.
    
    But even good water has mineral content. Over time, that shows up as:
    - Scale buildup inside your water heater tank, making it work harder and fail sooner
    - Sediment clogging tankless water heater heat exchangers (annual flushing prevents this)
    - White deposits on fixtures and showerheads
    - Valves that stick or don't shut off completely
    
    If you want the details, the City publishes an <a href="https://www.srcity.org/993/Water-Quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual water quality report</a>.
    If you're seeing buildup or want to extend the life of your plumbing, we can talk about filtration options.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## Santa Rosa's Summer Heat Problem
    
    Santa Rosa gets hot. Not San Francisco fog-belt hot—actually hot. 
    Summer days regularly hit the 90s, sometimes over 100°F.
    
    That heat matters for your plumbing:
    - **Water heaters work overtime** when you're running more showers, doing more laundry, and the incoming water is warmer. 
      We see more water heater failures in summer than any other season.
    - **Irrigation systems get heavy use**, which means more opportunities for leaks, broken heads, and backflow issues.
    - **Thermal expansion** in pipes can stress fittings, especially in attics and exterior walls that get direct sun.
    
    If your water heater is over 10 years old and you're heading into summer, it's worth having us take a look before it fails on the hottest day of the year.
  </div>

  <div class="two-column">
    ## Permits and the City of Santa Rosa
    
    The <a href="https://www.srcity.org/262/Building-Division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Santa Rosa Building Division</a> requires permits for water heater replacements, repiping, and sewer work.
    We pull permits when they're required. Some plumbers skip this step—it saves them time and you might not notice until you try to sell your home and the inspector flags unpermitted work.
    
    **If you're in a fire rebuild:** Your home went through extensive permitting during reconstruction. 
    If you're having plumbing issues now, we can help figure out whether something was missed or if it's normal wear on a system that's been running for several years.
    
    **If you're selling:** Get your sewer lateral inspected before you list. 
    If it fails, you'll need to repair or replace it before closing. Better to know now than during escrow.
