### A water heater install is about comfort now—and fewer problems later.

When your water heater is aging, leaking, or simply not keeping up, you’re not shopping for a box.
You’re trying to protect your home and get back to reliable hot water.

We install and replace water heaters with the same standard we’d want in our own home:
clear options, clean work, and no shortcuts.

Not sure whether replacement is the right move?
Start here: [water heater replacement signs](/articles/water-heater-replacement-signs/)
</div>

<div class="two-column">
## What to Do Right Now (If You Have a Leak or No Hot Water)

- If you see active leaking, shut off the cold supply to the heater.
- If the tank is leaking from the body, stop using it—tank leaks typically get worse.
- If you smell gas, leave the area and call your gas utility.
- If you need urgent help, start here: [24/7 emergency plumbing](/emergency-plumbing-services/).

[Call us](tel:7072008350) so we can help you choose the right next step.

<div class="one-column">
## How We Size the Right Water Heater (So You Don’t Regret the Install)
</div>

<div class="two-column">
### 1. Plumbing + Safety Check

We only recommend a solution after we look at what you and your home needs
to support the system safely and to code:

- Existing shutoffs, supply lines, and condition of connections
- Water pressure and flow rate
- Gas line and venting requirements (when applicable)
- Electrical requirements (when applicable)
- Location, clearances, and code items
</div>

<div class="two-column">
### 2. Hot Water Use Reality Check

We size based on how your household actually uses hot water:

- Number of people in the home
- Peak usage windows (mornings/evenings)
- Simultaneous fixtures (showers + laundry + dishwasher)
- Comfort expectations vs. efficiency priorities
</div>

<div class="two-column">
### 3. Options + Cost Clarity

Then we lay out the options clearly:

- Tank vs tankless vs heat pump
- Upfront cost vs operating cost
- What upgrades (if any) are required to do it correctly

If you want a deeper breakdown on what drives replacement cost, read:
[water heater replacement cost reasons](/articles/water-heater-replacement-cost-reasons/)
</div>

<div class="one-column">
## Water Heater Installation Options

Every household is different. We recommend the option that fits your home, usage, and budget.
</div>

<div class="two-column">
### Standard Tank Installation

- Remove and haul away the old unit
- Install the new tank water heater
- Make the necessary connection updates and safety checks
- Test performance before we leave
</div>

<div class="two-column">
### Tankless Installation

- Install a properly-sized tankless system
- Handle venting and gas sizing requirements (when applicable)
- Flush/commission the system and verify performance
</div>

<div class="two-column">
### Heat Pump Water Heater Installation

- Evaluate location/airflow needs and condensate routing
- Confirm electrical requirements
- Install and test for efficient operation
</div>

<div class="two-column">

You shouldn’t have to guess how to use your new system.
We walk you through:

- Temperature settings that balance comfort and safety
- Maintenance basics and what to watch for
- Warranty basics and what to keep for your records
